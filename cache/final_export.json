This leads to increasing concern that the \"Peace Olympics\" so much touted by the south Korean authorities can turn into \"Confrontation Olympics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole nation has already turned its back on such reptile media as Chosun Ilbo and Choongang Ilbo which are only keen on smear campaign and slandering, being devoid of impartiality and objectivity as media and such conservative politicians as Hong Jun Phyo and Jang Je Won engrossed in criticizing their fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the trend toward the improvement of inter-Korean relations is checked and mistrust and contradiction build up again due to the thoughtless acts of the conservative remnants aimed to tarnish our noble compatriotic measures, those who played havoc with the great cause of the nation and slandered their fellow countrymen will be made to own full responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are clearly reminded that the whole nation is closely following their future attitude."

Korean Conservatives Blasted for Chilling Atmosphere for Improved Inter-Korean Relations\r\nPyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- Ri Myong, councilor of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea, made public an article on Monday.\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the fact that the frozen inter-Korean ties have been put on the orbit of dialogue, cooperation and improved relations as desired by the entire Korean nation aspiring to the reunification from the outset of the year, the article went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean conservatives are making no scruple of letting out reckless remarks chilling the hardly-won atmosphere of the improvement of the inter-Korean relations, quite contrary to the unanimous expectations and desire of all the fellow countrymen and the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hong Jun Phyo, Kim Song Thae, Sim Jae Chol, Ham Jin Gyu, Ra Kyong Won, Kim Mu Song and Jang Je Won of the \"Liberal Korea Party\" and Ryu Sung Min and Ha Thae Gyong of the \"Parun Party\" and Jo Won Jin of \"Korean Patriotic Party\" are taking the lead in the smear campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those are crying out for \"further ratcheting up the sanctions and pressure for nuclear dismantlement of the north,\" describing our sincere proposal for dialogue and proactive measures for the improvement of the inter-Korean relations as \"the strategy to gain the time for completing the nuclear force\", \"the bogus peace offensive aimed at disintegrating the south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and \"an artifice for making a breakthrough in overcoming the sanctions.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the participation of the north side's sports team and big mission in the Winter Olympics welcomed by the entire Korean nation and the whole world, they even bluster that \"the Olympics should not be the venue for promotion of the north's social system\" and \"the flag of south Korea, not the Korean Peninsula flag, should be raised when the players of the north and the south make a joint entry\" and \"the formation of a single team will make the sportspersons of the south side abandon their dreams and future.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Representative of the \"Liberal Korea Party\" Hong Jun Phyo, who is the top-class political profiteer and chieftain of thieves without an equal in the south Korean political camp and is nicknamed a would-be rapist, \"Hong Quixote\", \"Hong Trump,\" etc. for his despicable words and deeds, claimed that \"the north is making the Phyongchang Olympics the Pyongyang Olympics with a spoon only\", \"it is the venue for promotion of Nazism\", and \"the north is using the international sports festival for the south-north political show\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ra Kyong Won sent the IOC a letter urging it not to allow the formation of the single team, stunning the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Head of the \"Korean Patriotic Party\" Jo Won Jin, who is a remnant of traitor Park Geun Hye, and other mad men are making desperate efforts to block the improvement of the north-south relations, while committing unpardonable atrocities chanting \"No participation of the north in the Olympics\" and defaming the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and burning the DPRK flag and the Korean Peninsula flag in the heart of Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are, indeed, human scum obsessed with pro-U.S. sycophancy and confrontation with the fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We reiterate that our measures are not ones for \"gaining time\", \"disintegrating south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and \"making a breakthrough in overcoming the sanctions\" but the important decision for the fellow countrymen and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever has national conscience even a bit would not run amuck to spoil the hardly-won climate of reconciliation, speaking ill of the exciting event brought about by such noble patriotism and love for compatriots and the fact that south Korea greatly benefits from the event.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitors staking their fates on the submission to the U.S. might regard the \"south Korea-U.S. alliance\" as an ancestral tablet but the south Korean candlelight demonstrators aspiring to independence and justice have already sentenced to death the alliance, no more than the humiliating relations between master and servant in colony, and are dynamically advancing along the road to national independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rapidly changing inter-Korean relations are the strict indictment and judgment on the thrice-cursed crimes of the conservative group of Lee Myung Bak and Park Geun Hye who drove the north-south relations to the worst catastrophe and the Korean Peninsula to the danger of a nuclear war while resorting to sycophancy to the U.S. and confrontation with the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If these traitors and psychopaths defaming the dignified Korean nation are allowed to go scot-free, the national reconciliation, unity and the building of a reunified powerful country will be delayed so much.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those committing evil doings, frightened by the mounting enthusiasm for national reconciliation and unity, should clearly understand that their reckless acts are big crimes before the nation and will pay high price for them."

Korean Conservative Forces' Shuddering Hideous Crime against Dignity of DPRK\r\nPyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country of the DPRK issued the following statement Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t A breakthrough was made in the improvement of the north-south ties and there is a warm wind for reconciliation thanks to the DPRK's sincere efforts, to be warmly welcomed by the whole Korean nation and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the puppet conservative forces have gone beyond a tolerance limit in their ill intention to chill the atmosphere for the improved north-south ties and ruin the great event of the nation, shocking the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A hideous provocative act, openly perpetrated in downtown Seoul in broad daylight on Jan 22, clearly proved that the wild act of the group of traitors challenging the trend of the national history toward the improvement of the north-south ties and reunification has reached the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with the arrival of our field survey delegation for dispatch of an art troupe in Seoul that day, coteries of the \"Korean Patriotic Party\" flocked to the plaza of Seoul Railways Station where they held a press interview and viciously slandered the DPRK's participation in the Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They went on the rampage, torching a portrait symbolizing the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and a DPRK flag, not content with talking hoarse that \"Phyongchang Olympics is about to change into Pyongyang Olympics for promoting the north's social system and making the north's nuclear weapons a fait accompli\" and \"dispatch of the north's cheering group and joint training at the Masikryong Ski Resort are an attempt to bring to naught the sweats and efforts exerted by inhabitants in Kangwon Province and Phyongchang\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a never-to-be-condoned hideous crime as it is an intolerable mockery of the sincerity and efforts being made by the DPRK for the improvement of the north-south relations and a deliberate political provocation to turn the Olympics into a theatre for escalating confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from making a deep bow to the fellow countrymen for their sincere efforts for the successful Olympics, the conservative group resorted to all sorts of slandering and committed such shuddering acts in the eyes of the delegation of the DPRK. They are a despicable group of gangsters in human form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces who had been pushed into the cesspool of history being severely punished by history for their acts of treachery under the armpit of Lee Myung Bak and Park Geun Hye, are now going on the rampage, making hideous provocations. This is a shame to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is deplorable that due to a handful of betes noires, our efforts and the desire of all Koreans to make the Olympics a great auspicious event common to the nation are being mocked and dark clouds lay low over the prospect of the Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative forces are human rejects devoid of appearance as human beings, to say nothing of elementary etiquette and manners toward the fellow countrymen, and dregs of history that would do only harm to the nation if they are allowed to go at large.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the south Koreans from all walks of life raise their voices calling for throwing overboard those rubbish so that they would not give off stinking smell any more, being concerned that such acts omen new trouble in the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the south Korean authorities' behavior of conniving at such serious politically-motivated provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As we truly hoped for the Olympics becoming a theater for promoting trust and reconciliation between the north and the south, we repeatedly advised and warned them so as to keep any acts that may incite mistrust and confrontation between the fellow countrymen and get on the nerves of the dialogue partner from being occurred.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though they watched the reckless confrontation moves committed by the conservatives, the south Korean authorities have taken a non-committal stand, reading the faces of those conservatives who are no more than living corpses, while talking about \"freedom of expression\" and only asking them to \"restrain\". No wonder, the situation is turning out to be worse, far from being brought under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is little short of egging the conservative group on to foster such acts so that they go on the rampage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal acts committed by the conservative forces with no fear of divine punishment have now greatly enraged the people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never tolerate hideous acts of the conservative hooligans who insulted the sacred dignity and symbol of the DPRK, and the dishonest behavior of the south Korean authorities who connived at such acts, and we can not but take a serious consideration of our follow-up measures regarding the Winter Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have to apologize before the nation for the political provocation, severely punish those involved in the crime and take a prompt measure to prevent the recurrence of such acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the north-south agreement and schedules for the DPRK's participation in the Olympics are cancelled due to the confrontational act of the conservative riff-raffs keen on spouting vituperation and committing provocative acts against the fellow countrymen, the blame will wholly rest with the conservative group and the south Korean authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We value the north-south ties but have no intention to continue to show good faith and magnanimity even while seeing the confrontational fanatics dare challenge the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its sacred symbol.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will closely follow the future attitude of the south Korean authorities concerning the recent hideous crime."

intercoreanas y se da la atmosfera de reconciliacion nacional, hecho que causa fuertes aplausos de toda la nacion y todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn contraste, dejan consternados a los nacionales y extranjeros las acciones demenciales de los conservadores surcoreanos encaminadas a congelar el ambiente favorable a la mejora de relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas y llevar al fracaso los eventos nacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl tremendo caso de provocacion, ocurrido el dia 22 a plena luz del dia en la parte centrica de Seul, muestra a que grado llega el desafio de ellos a la corriente de la historia nacional hacia la mejora de relaciones Norte-Sur y la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse dia, coincidiendo con la llegada a Seul de la delegacion de recorrido en el terreno de la parte Norte para el envio del grupo de artistas, los tipejos del Partido Patriotico de Corea sostuvieron en la Plaza de la Estacion de Seul una conferencia de prensa censurando brutalmente la participacion de la RPDC en los Juegos Olimpicos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos chismearon en esa ocasion que \"la Olimpiada de Phyongchang se convierte en la de Pyongyang para hacer propaganda del regimen norcoreano y reconocer su posesion de arma nuclear\" y \"el envio del grupo de hinchas del Norte y los ejercicios conjuntos en el Campo de Esqui Masikryong parten del intento de hacer nulos el sudor y los esfuerzos de la poblacion de la provincia de Kangwon y de Phyongchang\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo si esto fuera poco, quemaron hasta la bandera de la RPDC y el retrato considerado como simbolo de la dignidad de nuestra Direccion Suprema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste crimen resulta una burla intolerable a los esfuerzos sinceros de la RPDC por la mejora de vinculos Norte-Sur y una premeditada provocacion politica para convertir los juegos olimpicos en el escenario de enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLejos de agradecer a la parte connacional que hace todo lo posible para la celebracion exitosa del festival deportivo, los gangsteres conservadores surcoreanos dijeron blasfemias de toda indole y cometieron dicho crimen inimaginable y escalofriante en la cara de nuestra delegacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una verguenza nacional que los remanentes conservadores, condenados por la historia por sus crimenes traidores cometidos bajo el amparo de Lee Myung Bak y Park Geun-hye, anduvieran otra vez con la frente alta volviendo a escenificar tremendos actos provocativos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy lamentable que debido a un punado de esos desperdicios biologicos, sean burlados los esfuerzos de la RPDC y el anhelo de toda la nacion de celebrar los juegos olimpicos como una fiesta comun de la nacion y se entenebrezcan las perspectivas de esta cita deportiva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos conservadores surcoreanos son basuras de la historia que no observan la elemental cortesia ni la moralidad sobre la parte connacional y hacen danos a la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que los habitantes surcoreanos de diferentes estratos reclamaran en voz alta enterrar lo mas pronto posible a esas escorias humanas diciendo que las locuras de estas anuncian nuevo contratiempo de las relaciones N-S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave del caso es la actitud de las autoridades surcoreanas que dejaron a los conservadores cometer publicamente su grave provocacion politica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el deseo de que los Juegos Olimpicos se hagan el escenario para promover la confianza y reconciliacion entre ambas partes coreanas, dimos a las autoridades surcoreanas consejos y advertencias suficientes para que ellas hagan lo que les toca en prevenir todas formas de actos que azucen la desconfianza y confrontacion entre los compatriotas e irriten a la contraparte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque conocen bien la oleada de enfrentamiento levantada por los elementos conservadores, las autoridades surcoreanas se portan acorde al estado de humor de esos cadaveres vivos hablando de la \"libertad de expresion\" y limitandose a \"pedirles que se controlen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imposible que esa actitud tibia corrija la situacion que se torna cada vez mas fea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal comportamiento de las autoridades surcoreanas da lo mismo que el acto criminal de alentar la locura de las fuerzas conservadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos crimenes de esas ultimas montan en colera al pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo perdonaremos nunca el acto grosero e infame de esos gangsteres, que insultaron la sagrada dignidad y simbolo de la RPDC, y la conducta injusta de las autoridades surcoreanas que lo toleraron.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY nos vemos obligados a considerar en serio las posteriores medidas de accion relativas con los Juegos Olimpicos Invernales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deberan pedir disculpas a toda la nacion coreana por el presente caso de provocacion politica y tomar las medidas consecuentes para prevenir la repeticion tras castigar duro a los involucrados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se cancelan los acuerdos intercoreanos y las agendas para la participacion del Norte en los Juegos Olimpicos debido a la chusma conservadora que se dedica a injuriar y provocar a la parte connacional, toda la responsabilidad recaera sobre ella y las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApreciamos las relaciones de ambas partes coreanas, pero no queremos seguir dando muestras de buena fe e indulgencia hasta cuando veamos la groseria de los maniacos de enfrentamiento que con sus tremendos actos provocadores, desafiaron a los sagrados simbolos de la dignidad de nuestra  Direccion Suprema y nuestro Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObservamos agudamente la posterior postura de las autoridades surcoreanas sobre el presente caso."

                "content": "U.S. Urged to Abandon Its Scheme to Prevent Detente on Korean Peninsula\r\nPyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- Choe Song Ho, a researcher of the room for international policy studies at the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, on Jan. 25 issued a commentary titled \"The U.S. should abandon its foolish scheme to prevent detente on the Korean Peninsula\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary condemns the U.S., which once cried out for a peaceful solution to the Korean Peninsula issue, for making every possible effort to stop the present affirmative development of the inter-Korean relations based on concerted efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical of such attempts is what the U.S did at the \"foreign ministers' meeting on the security and stability on the Korean Peninsula\" held in Vancouver of Canada, it says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting was, in fact, for confab on a new war, not on the stability of the peninsula. It was attended by 20 countries and regions, including those which participated in the Korean War against the DPRK in the 1950s. At the meeting, the U.S. wooed them to ratchet up the sanctions and pressure on the DPRK with threatening words and cried out for a military option again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson, in particular, fanned the confrontation with the DPRK by claiming that the efficiency of the U.S.-led maximum pressure strategy, such as sea blockade, should be raised and all the nations should pool their efforts to make the north pay more dearly. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mattis, who appeared before the audience in neckties, made such violent remarks like the boss of gangsters that the scenario for war with north Korea has been ready and unless the meeting goes well, defense ministers' meeting will be held next, which stunned the audience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Heavyweights of the U.S. political circle and administration made no scruple of hurling a stream of provocative remarks that it is high time the U.S. took the initiative by putting the DPRK on the defensive, it is necessary to stop the present trend in which the U.S. overturned with the DPRK's appeasement policy, and the Trump administration is very seriously examining the military option against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a more serious attention is that the U.S. is further aggravating the tension by deliberately revealing that the extremely dangerous military action targeting the Korean Peninsula is not hot air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been recently disclosed that an electronic warfare plane and a formation of special operation planes were secretly deployed in south Korea for ultra-precision surveillance on the DPRK. Those planes were said to have proved their combat effectiveness in theatres of wars such as former Yugoslavia, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such ill-boding movements of the U.S., timed to coincide with the creation of a new climate for the detente and peace, go to prove that what the U.S. wants awake or asleep is not peace and stability on the peninsula but instability and the exacerbation of military tension and start of war for aggression on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have earnestly and repeatedly requested their American master to help them successfully hold the Winter Olympics they managed to have held in south Korea, but the answer was such disturbing movements and the aggravation of tension. Therefore, they have to know what a foolish thing they have expected.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality requires all Koreans to get awakened lest the U.S. meddle in the Korean Peninsula issue any longer and decisively reject such intervention by their concerted efforts in order to successfully hold the forthcoming great national event and bring about a turning point in the north-south relations development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is advised to understand that it would be seriously mistaken if it thinks that the situation of the peninsula would change as intended by it and would be controlled by it as it used to do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should be well aware of the Korean nation's fixed will for independent reunification and its powerful strength for peace, stop the reckless provocative adventures and make a reasonable and rational choice, though belatedly."

It is a nuclear criminal state which has huge stockpile of all kinds of nuclear lethal weapons and drives the world into an outbreak of nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been the consistent policy of the previous U.S. authorities to realize wild ambition for world domination by relying on absolute nuclear supremacy, and Trump administration is more frantic for its realization, as befits a faithful advocate of the U.S. military monopolies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States has stated through the Review that it will develop new nuclear weapons including low yield tactical nuclear warhead and carry out preemptive strike against adversaries whether the latters' attack is nuclear or conventional, and thus, the U.S. has made declaration of war against the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly shows that Trump is seeking nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our state completed war deterrent in order to protect our sovereignty and rights to existence and development from the half-a-century-long nuclear threat of the U.S. However, the U.S. recklessly denounces our deterrent as a \"threat\" to world peace. This is a high manifestation of the thief turning on the master with a club.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is becoming all the more undisguised in its attempt to maintain its sphere of world domination by wantonly violating the international law, clinging to highhandedness and arbitrariness, and wildly brandishing its nuclear club. Today's stern reality proves that we were absolutely right in having bolstered up the nuclear deterrent, braving through all difficulties, upholding the line of simultaneously developing the two fronts, and it further hardens our determination to resolutely continue the road we chose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power, the DPRK will not use nuclear weapons unless aggressive hostile forces infringe upon our sovereignty and interest and will not threaten any nation or region with nuclear weapons. However, we will strongly counter any acts of destroying peace and security of the Korean peninsula."

En esa ocasion, el dijo que \"solo se ha ajustado el programa\" para que el simulacro no coincida con la olimpiada y \"lo reiniciaria de inmediato\" una vez terminada la cita deportiva.\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, hablaron asi el portavoz del Departamento de Defensa y el encargado de negocios a. i. norteamericano en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste acto verbal persigue el siniestro intento de romper la atmosfera de mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas, creada con motivo de la participacion de la RPDC en el evento deportivo, y la corriente de su evolucion. Ademas, resulta un desafio frontal a nuestros esfuerzos sinceros por aliviar la tension y preparar el ambiente pacifico de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de hoy y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos reinician los ejercicios militares conjuntos de gran envergadura contra la RPDC tan pronto como terminaran los Juegos Olimpicos Invernales, se tambalearan las relaciones intercoreanas, que dieron apenas el primer paso de mejoramiento, y la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana volvera a la coyuntura catastrofica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa responsabilidad de todas sus consecuencias recaera totalmente a EE.UU. y los belicistas del circulo militar surcoreano que amenazan de esa manera la paz desoyendo las unanimes voces de rechazo de los nacionales y extranjeros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos deben actuar con prudencia al darse cuenta de que seran criticados y condenados mas fuertemente por la nacion coreana y la sociedad internacional si no dejan su plan de ejercicios de guerra nuclear que impondran tremendos desastres a la Peninsula Coreana."

The international community is expecting the DPRK to show greater sincerity and concession over the denuclearization issue if it truly hopes for promoting the detente on the Korean peninsula. Unless it does so, it will be difficult for the DPRK to attain its purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the same day, the Global Times of China's People's Daily carried an argument made by a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies that restoring inter-Korean relations without touching on the nuclear issue is unsustainable and fragile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier in January, some Chinese media made wicked assertions that the sustenance of the atmosphere for detente on the Korean peninsula is closely related to the solution of the \"nuclear issue of the DPRK\" and that \"detente will not last long without common recognition of the denuclearization\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such incoherent talks heard from Chinese media can not but be retorted as an arrogant act aimed at interference in the internal issue of the Korean nation and an unreasonable logic and sophism ignorant of the essence of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obvious is the stand of the DPRK to successfully hold the Winter Olympics as a national event and fully display the dignity and might of the Korean nation and, therefore, this is supported and welcomed by all the fellow countrymen and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only the U.S. and other outsiders who are to blame for the division of the Korean Peninsula and the tension there that stand against the Korean nation working hard to open up a new chapter for peace on the peninsula by its concerted efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t China's experts and media, that have touted for \"peaceful solution\" to the Korean peninsula issue whenever an opportunity presented itself, now shun the present positive development of the situation and are arguing for and against while setting the DPRK's participation in the Winter Olympics against its strategic issue. How can such behavior be interpreted as an act of allegedly \"disinterested\" neighbors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidently an act of screwballs feeling dissatisfaction with the north and the south of Korea aspiring after detente and peace, and a mischievous act to reverse and divert the international focus away from the atmosphere for the north-south reconciliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It reminds one of a mean fellow looking over the fence of a feast host.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Winter Olympics has nothing to do with \"denuclearization\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As acknowledged by the world, the DPRK's possession of nuclear deterrence was a legitimate option for self-defense reflective of the stern historical lesson and the reality in which the DPRK's sincere efforts for the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula were ignored and the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK aimed to destroy its sovereignty and rights to existence and development has daily increased.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At this time, swimming against the atmosphere of peace on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. is rendering to the extremes the political and military threat and brandishing a fireball after shipping huge aggression forces including all sorts of ultramodern nuclear war weapons to the sky, land and sea, thereby threatening the Winter Olympics and the post-Olympics situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one truly hopes for peace on the Korean Peninsula and regional stability, it is reasonable for one to say what it should do to the trouble-maker U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is illogical for the Chinese media to absurdly vociferate about \"denuclearization\", far from saying what it should do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, is an event of \"denuclearization\" ever on the list of the Winter Olympics?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Call a spade a spade. It is very despicable of those Chinese media to mess with their neighbor's event, far from offering congratulations to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ignoring the reality and occasion, they are forcibly linking the issue of \"denuclearization\" to the Olympics, which cannot be interpreted otherwise than an act aimed to spoil others' feast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They betrayed the dark intention to distract the international caution focused on them to the DPRK by doggedly standing in the way of creating reconciliation atmosphere between the north and the south of Korea that would have a positive impact on the world peace and the development of the regional situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are trying to hold the issue of inter-Korean relations on nuclear issue leash and use it as leverage for interference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They, in the long run, left the international community unpleasant feelings that the \"initiative and proactive neighboring diplomacy\" only seeks interference in the internal affairs of other countries and nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently they slandered the DPRK's measure for self-defense as \"narrow-minded interpretation of outside and self-justified action in the nuclear and missile issue\". They also belittled the military capabilities of the DPRK, quoting a \"conclusion drawn after inspecting from the south side position in Panmunjom\". Now to what extent have they reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some experts and media of China engrossed in admonishing others are now showing the same proclivity as the Trump and Abe groups and the conservative riff-raffs of south Korea marginalized after being isolated and rejected in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going blind in judging the trend of the times would make one face great disappointment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such senseless meddling doesn't fit the appearance of a \"power\"."

He stepped up the cause of army building by dint of his outstanding ideas and energetic leadership, thereby founding the Korean People's Army, the revolutionary regular armed forces of the Juche type, in a matter of less than three years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army is, both in name and in reality, a revolutionary army that inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle?the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and its rich fighting experience and adroit art of warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the birth of this Juche-oriented regular army our Republic, from the very beginning after its founding, enjoyed the prestige of being a dignified people's country with its own strong armed forces; it defeated the imperialist aggressor forces that had been boasting of being the \"mightiest\" in the world and achieved a great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 25, 1932, the day when our revolutionary armed forces began to take historical roots, was fundamental to vanquishing the brigandish Japanese imperialists and realizing the sacred cause of national liberation; February 8, 1948, the birthday of our regular armed forces that inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle, was crucial to the great victory of the Fatherland Liberation War and the successful advance of our socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole course of historic development of the Korean People's Army has been accompanied by constant tension and intense confrontation in the world's largest powder-keg and hottest spot which is pregnant with the danger of outbreak of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being faithful to its mission of defending the country, the revolution and the people, our army has smashed the enemy's adventurous provocations at every step, upholding the military line of self-reliant defence and the banner of \"a-match-for-a-hundred.\" In the course of this, it has been developed into an invincible combat force capable of defeating any enemy, however formidable, at a stroke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the grimmest and most difficult period when it had to fight against the allied imperialist forces of the world single-handed, with no flanks and with no support from outside, our People's Army performed remarkable exploits by waging a heroic, do-or-die struggle in the first line of the revolution under the leadership of the great Comrade Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As this elite revolutionary army played the role of the standard-bearer and solid cornerstone for defending socialism and the revolution at the forefront of the anti-imperialist military front and the construction of a prosperous country, our Republic has won one brilliant victory after another in the battle to safeguard socialism and gained the high reputation of a world-class military power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In world history cannot be found any other nation that accomplished the great cause of army building from scratch by relying on its internal forces and built an elite army in spite of the protracted, worst-ever challenges and blockade; such brilliant exploit of building a powerful army for the sake of national prosperity is a miracle that can be wrought only by the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the peerless patriots and iron-willed commanders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officers and men of the People's Army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army, which made its first fine appearance through a magnificent parade 70 years previously, has become what it is today, hoisting the flag of victory in the fierce battle fields in defence of the country and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army, which has grown up into a world-class powerful army, is a stout pillar in preventing the catastrophe of war and defending peace on the Korean peninsula and in the region and a force that makes breakthroughs in the vanguard of the grand march of our people towards final victory for the socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now our people regard as their great pride our brave People's Army which is struggling with the spirit and stamina of Paektu, and are gaining fresh strength and courage from the militant might of our army which is growing stronger day by day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army has won the sincere affection and trust of the people at the cost of blood, sweat and death-defying devotion, achieved oneness with them enjoying their enthusiastic support and assistance, and performed feats on the fronts for defending the country and building socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a source of pride for our Party and state and a great fortune of our people that they have such a dignified and powerful revolutionary army, an army of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I deem it the highest honour to have assumed the heavy responsibility of supreme command of the courageous revolutionary army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, the government of the Republic and all the people, I once again warmly congratulate all the officers and men on the occasion of the 70th founding anniversary of the heroic Korean People's Army, and extend militant greetings to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Combatants of the units participating in this parade and all the other officers and men of the People's Army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the Party and the country have high expectations of it and the people are sincere in their affection for it, the People's Army must defend the country and the people reliably through faithful service and devoted struggle as befits the army of the Party and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army should increase its political and military capabilities to the maximum as suited to the status of our dignified state to meet the demands of the times and the developing revolution, and firmly guarantee by force of arms the struggle of our Party and people to accomplish the socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The central task facing the People's Army at present is to perfect its combat capabilities as befitting a revolutionary army by holding aloft the banner of modelling the entire army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and implementing to the letter the strategic lines and tasks for increasing the military strength put forward by the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army should be boundlessly loyal to the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army is the army of our Party which was born and built up in the embrace of the Party; the source of its mightiness lies in the Party's revolutionary ideas and leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should become the first death-defying corps, the first guards unit, sharing its destiny with the Workers' Party of Korea and defending its Central Committee with arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should firmly establish the unified leadership system of the Party within itself, create a revolutionary military climate in which all its service personnel move as one under the command of the Party, and organize and conduct all types of military work on the basis of the Party's lines and policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should maintain strengthening itself politically and ideologically and making itself morally sound as its two major tasks, and concentrate all its efforts on preparing itself as an army that is strong in ideology and faith like the 7th Regiment during the anti-Japanese war and the Guards units during the Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should raise more fiercely the flames of the revolution in training to improve its capability of fighting a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Training is precisely the way to defending the socialist country and the people, and the short-cut to turning the People's Army into a powerful army is to make the most exacting demand upon its soldiers under training.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should steadily improve the content, style and method of training in line with the Party's ideas on military strategy and tactics, with the demands of the Juche-oriented tactics and with the demands and features of modern warfare, and should not stop even a day practical training in a virtual combat environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present situation, in which the United States and its vassal forces are making a fuss around the Korean peninsula, the People's Army should remain on full alert and give a spur to perfecting its combat preparedness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus we must prevent any aggressive forces from violating or offending the dignity and sovereignty of our sacred country in the slightest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Units of all services, arms and corps must intensify training aimed at having a command of their military hardware and improving their specialist levels, so as to make full preparations for waging hi-tech warfare in any operational space.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the People's Army must present building itself up into an army, which is excellent in all aspects, as an important strategic task in line with the requirements of the new, higher stage of turning the entire army into an army of cadres and modernizing it, and give top priority to its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army must establish rigid ethos and assume the appearance of a perfect regular army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel, from privates to generals, should be well versed in military regulations and manuals, and make it part of their habit to abide by them, thus ensuring that all units, sub-units and other places where there are soldiers always present regularized features.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the officers and men of the army, always bearing in mind that the People's Army cannot exist even a moment separated from the people, must boundlessly respect and love them, and constantly sustain the fine traits of the revolutionary army, whose soldiers defy death if it is for the sake of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army must not weigh the importance of undertakings intended for the people, but regard it as a revolutionary military climate to devote all its sincerity with the most honest attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Holding higher the patriotic, revolutionary slogan \"Let us take upon ourselves both national defence and socialist construction,\" it should give free rein to its unexcelled heroism in all places for translating the people's dreams and ideals into reality by displaying fortitude and creativity, not knowing the word impossible, and continuously take the lead in the struggle for transforming the country into a more beautiful land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as imperialism exists on the globe and the United States persists in following its hostile policy against our country, the mission of the People's Army, as a powerful sword for defending the country, people and peace, can never be changed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Final victory belongs to our Party and people with a firm grip on the arms of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party and people are fully convinced that the Korean People's Army, which has provided a military guarantee for the revolutionary cause of Juche, will continue to reliably defend the Party and the revolution, the country and the people, and increase its strength in every way possible to safeguard justice and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as we have the Korean People's Army that is unfailingly loyal to the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea, our glorious motherland?the Democratic People's Republic of Korea?will grow more powerful and more prosperous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel of the People's Army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The flag of the ever-victorious Workers' Party of Korea will always lead the way ahead of you, giving you a great encouragement and rousing you to fresh struggle and victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us fight bravely for the Party and the revolution, the country and the people."

The purpose behind these moves is crystal clear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Abe quarters are now relying on all kinds of deceptions and tricks to revise the constitution by any means and make Japan a country that can conduct a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese reactionaries still think that they can put the sovereignty of Korea on a chopping board and chop it together with neighboring countries as in the past, there is no greater mistake.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese reactionaries like Kono keep on clinging to anti-DPRK confrontational mania without any sense of their current status, it will result in digging out their graves by their own hands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities would be well advised to show discretion and prudence with clear understanding on the might of the DPRK that has now become a full-fledged strategic state."

Mis calurosas felicitaciones y saludos militantes a los veteranos de la guerra, desmovilizados y todos los militares que conmemoran el aniversario del ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMi mas sincero agradecimiento a nuestros obreros, campesinos y otros sectores del pueblo que con complacencia envian a sus hijos adorados a los puestos de defensa y en medio de pruebas y dificultades han preparado con preferencia absoluta cuanto hacia falta para la combatividad del Ejercito Popular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl igual que el 25 de abril en que el gran Lider organizo el Ejercito Revolucionario Popular de Corea, el 8 de febrero en que fundo el Ejercito Popular de Corea, fuerzas armadas revolucionarias regulares, es un dia historico de gran trascendencia para la construccion de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias y la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTener un poderoso ejercito nacional era un sueno adorado de la nacion coreana, que estaba condenada a la miserable vida de la apatrida a falta de un ejercito que valiera la pena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste anhelo secular se hizo realidad setenta anos atras gracias a la acertada orientacion del gran Lider Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras la liberacion del pais, el gran Lider presento la creacion de un poderoso ejercito regular como requisito indispensable de la construccion de un Estado soberano e independiente e impulso esa tarea con su extraordinaria idea y energica direccion, fundando en menos de tres anos el EPC, autoctonas fuerzas armadas regulares revolucionarias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos hablando de un ejercito revolucionario que mantiene al pie de la letra las tradiciones de la lucha antijaponesa, heredando el indomable espiritu revolucionario, ricas experiencias y habiles metodos de combate del Ejercito Revolucionario Popular de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el nacimiento de autoctonas fuerzas regulares, nuestra Republica pudo emerger desde el comienzo como dignificante pais del pueblo con su propia segura garantia militar, vencer a las tropas agresoras imperialistas que se jactaban de la \"supremacia\" mundial y obtener una gran victoria en la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 25 de abril de 1932 en que echaron sus raices nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias hizo posible derrotar al vandalico imperio nipon y lograr la sagrada causa de la emancipacion nacional. Y el 8 de febrero de 1948, dia de nacimiento de las fuerzas armadas regulares herederas de las tradiciones antijaponesas, nos permitio obtener un gran triunfo en la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria y proseguir el avance victorioso de la causa socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el trayecto del EPC estuvo caracterizado por un prolongado estado de tension y un intenso enfrentamiento en el mayor polvorin y el punto mas candente del mundo con el inminente peligro de una nueva guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiel a su mision de defender a la patria, la revolucion y el pueblo, nuestro ejercito frustro todas las arriesgadas provocaciones del enemigo con la linea militar de autodefensa y la consigna de uno contra cien en alto, fortaleciendose en ese transcurso en indestructibles tropas de combate capaces de vencer de un golpe a cualquier enemigo poderoso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los mas arduos y dificiles momentos en que hemos tenido que bregar solos contra la alianza imperialista, sin flanco ni refuerzo, el Ejercito Popular ha realizado grandes proezas en la heroica lucha de muerte en la primera linea de la revolucion bajo la direccion del gran General.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor contar con un ejercito revolucionario elite, puntal inconmovible y abanderado en la defensa del socialismo y la revolucion en el frente antimperialista y la avanzada de la construccion de una patria rica y poderosa, nuestra Republica ha logrado triunfos sucesivos y contundentes en la defensa del socialismo y exhibido su aspecto imponente como una de las mayores potencias militares del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo tiene su parangon en la historia el milagro de haber logrado por su propia cuenta la gran obra de la fundacion del ejercito sobre las ruinas y preparado las mas poderosas fuerzas militares en medio del mas persistente desafio y bloqueo. Esta es una inmensa proeza que pueden realizar solamente el gran Lider y el gran General, eminentes patriotas y comandantes de acero, en su empeno de enriquecer a la nacion y fortalecer al ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl EPC, que con pasos firmes partio solemnemente de la plaza hace siete decadas, ha llegado al presente izando la bandera de triunfo en todos los campos de batallas encarnizadas en defensa de la patria y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFormado hoy como el mas poderoso del mundo, constituye el firme pilar de defensa de la paz que previene la catastrofe en la Peninsula Coreana y sus cercanias, asi como la patrulla que encabeza la gran marcha de nuestro pueblo hacia el triunfo definitivo del socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy, nuestro pueblo siente un gran orgullo por tener su valiente ejercito que lucha sin descanso con el espiritu e impetu del monte Paektu y encuentra renovada fuerza y animo en la combatividad de nuestro ejercito que se eleva cada dia mas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon ardiente sangre y sudor y entrega total ha conquistado el verdadero amor y confianza del pueblo y con el fervoroso respaldo y apoyo del pueblo logra la unidad monolitica y protagoniza hazanas en la defensa nacional y la construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTener tan imponente y poderoso ejercito de la revolucion y del pueblo es el orgullo de nuestro Partido y Estado y la gran dicha de nuestro pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara mi es un gran honor asumir la responsabilidad del comandante supremo que dirige a un valeroso ejercito revolucionario como ustedes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn nombre del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, el gobierno de la Republica y todo el pueblo, vuelvo a felicitar y saludar fervorosamente a todos los oficiales y soldados del heroico EPC en ocasion del aniversario 70 de su fundacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCombatientes de las columnas en la parada y demas militares del EPC:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mayores sean la confianza del Partido y la patria y el amor del pueblo hacia ustedes, tanto mas deben esforzarse para defender la patria y la nacion con su sincero servicio y abnegacion como ejercito del Partido y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Ejercito Popular debe consolidar por todos los medios el poderio politico y militar correspondiente a la posicion de nuestro prestigioso Estado en consonancia con la demanda de la epoca y la revolucion en desarrollo y asegurar militarmente la lucha de nuestro Partido y pueblo para culminar la causa socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tarea principal que tiene hoy por delante es completar su combatividad como ejercito revolucionario al materializar cabalmente la linea estrategica y las tareas presentadas por el Partido para su fortalecimiento, enarbolando la consigna de su identificacion con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera ilimitadamente fiel a la direccion del Partido del Trabajo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos hablando de un ejercito nacido y formado en el regazo del Partido y que tiene la idea revolucionaria y la direccion de este como fuente de su poderio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe compete ser el primer cuerpo y guardia que defienden con el fusil al Comite Central del Partido, confiandole su destino.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario establecer cabalmente en todo su seno el sistema de direccion unica del Partido, implantar un ambiente revolucionario que le permite acatar sus ordenes e indicaciones como un solo hombre y organizar y realizar todas las labores en atencion a sus lineamientos y politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben asumir como dos tareas primordiales el fortalecimiento del ejercito en lo politico-ideologico y en lo moral y dedicar ingentes esfuerzos a convertirlo en fuerzas de firme idea y fe como el septimo regimiento de la guerrilla antijaponesa y las unidades vanguardia de la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Ejercito Popular intensificara mas el entrenamiento para elevar la capacidad de combate real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui precisamente una manera de defender a la patria socialista y el pueblo y siendo mas exigente con los ejercicios se puede formar cuanto antes a un poderoso ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso renovar sin cesar el contenido, la forma y el metodo de los ejercicios de acuerdo con la estrategia, tactica e ideologia militares del Partido y con la exigencia y modalidad del autoctono metodo de combate y de la guerra moderna y no interrumpir ni un momento los ejercicios practicos que asemejan la batalla real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora que Estados Unidos y sus seguidores forman alborotos en la Peninsula Coreana y sus cercanias, le atane mantener una vigilancia extrema y dar mas acicate a los preparativos de guerra, de modo que los agresores no se atrevan a violar ni afrentar en modo alguno la dignidad y soberania nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas unidades de diversos ejercitos, armas y especialidades tendran un buen dominio de sus armamentos, se entrenaran para la mayor especializacion y de esta manera estaran siempre listas para combatir con alta tecnologia en cualquier operacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, de acuerdo con la exigencia de una nueva fase para convertir a todo el ejercito en el de cuadros y modernizarlo, presentaran como importante tarea estrategica la excelente preparacion de sus efectivos en todos los aspectos y prestaran primordial atencion a su realizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl Ejercito Popular le atane establecer una ferrea disciplina militar y perfeccionar su aspecto como fuerzas regulares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los militares, desde el soldado hasta el general, haran suyas las normas y reglas establecidas y se acostumbraran a observarlas. Las unidades y subunidades y los militares demostraran su aspecto como fuerzas regulares en cualquier lugar y momento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiempre conscientes de que no pueden vivir un instante separados de la poblacion, todos los oficiales y soldados la respetaran y amaran de todo corazon y mantendran el bello rasgo del ejercito revolucionario que se arriesga para defenderla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPensaran que para el pueblo no existen tareas importantes o menudas y consideraran como un estilo revolucionario dedicarle todo lo suyo con una actitud de ilimitada sinceridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnarbolando mas la consigna patriotica y revolucionaria de Encarguemonos tanto de la defensa nacional como de la construccion socialista, mostraran el heroismo sin par en todas las obras para materializar el sueno e ideal del pueblo, con el espiritu creador y la combatividad que todo lo hacen posible, y seguiran siendo los primeros en embellecer a nuestra patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que persista el imperialismo en la Tierra y continue la politica hostil de Estados Unidos a Corea, jamas puede variar la mision del Ejercito Popular como poderoso remedio para defender el pais, el pueblo y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa victoria final pertenece a nuestro Partido y pueblo que empunan con firmeza el fusil de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos seguros de que el Ejercito Popular de Corea, que ha venido asegurando con las armas la causa revolucionaria del Juche, seguira salvaguardando como muralla de acero al Partido, la revolucion, la patria y el pueblo y multiplicando su capacidad como defensor de la justicia y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor tener al Ejercito Popular de Corea ilimitadamente fiel a la direccion del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, nuestra gloriosa patria, la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, sera eternamente poderosa y prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDelante de ustedes flameara siempre la bandera del invencible Partido del Trabajo de Corea, dandoles un gran estimulo y conduciendolos hacia una nueva lucha y victoria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Luchemos con valentia por el Partido, la revolucion, la patria y el pueblo!"

Ahora, actua groseramente para utilizar los 23o Juegos Olimpicos Invernales de caracter pacifico como un escenario para incitar la maxima presion y sancion contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, el canciller japones Kono insistio en Pakistan, los Emiratos Arabes Unidos, Canada, China y otros paises en la necesidad de presion anti-RPDC y sigue instigando a los paises que tienen las relaciones diplomaticas con la RPDC la ejecucion completa de las \"resoluciones de sancion economica\" y la ruptura de las relaciones diplomaticas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvaluo de alto el \"reporte de revision del estado nuclear\" de la administracion Trump que demostro abiertamente la ambicion de amenazar con armas nucleares a otros paises soberanos y dominar a todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos gobernantes japoneses perdieron ya la calidad de hablar de la paz y la estabilidad, ya que apoyan y defienden la politica de garrote nuclear de EE.UU. que impuso en dos ocasiones los desastres nucleares al pueblo japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, las palabras y acciones de Kono que esta al frente de la campana de sancion y presion anti-RPDC demuestran que este tipejo no pasa de ser una marioneta de EE.UU. y vocero del representante norteamericano acreditado en Tokio, que no tiene ni la logica elemental ni el conocimiento comun ni las cualidades del diplomatico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, otros caudillos de las fuerzas gobernantes de Japon insisten a porfia en la ejecucion de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" anti-RPDC del Consejo de la ONU, que hacen recordar la inquisicion de la edad medieval, e infunden el ambiente de enfrentamiento, lisonjeando a EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, las banda de Abe se vale de todas las artimanas y fraudes para enmendar a toda costa la Constitucion a fin de convertir Japon en el pais capaz de hacer la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria una gran equivocacion si los reaccionarios japoneses tratan a la RPDC con la concepcion del siglo pasado cuando violaba arbitrariamente el Poder estatal de Corea junto con los paises vecinos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Kono y otros reaccionarios japoneses siguen recurriendo a la locura conflictiva anti-RPDC sin tener en cuenta la situacion de si mismos, adelantaran mas su autodestruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas han de actuar con prudencia tomando en cuenta el poderio de la RPDC que ha situado dignamente en la posicion de Estado estrategico."
