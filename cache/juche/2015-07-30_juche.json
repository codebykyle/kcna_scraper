Rim was accused of making subversive plots and activities against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were officials concerned, Korean media persons and those of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, foreign correspondents, staff members of diplomatic missions here and overseas Koreans staying in the socialist homeland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's law enforcement organ arrested Rim who acted as a servant of the U.S. imperialists and south Korean puppet group. He malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership and social system of the DPRK and resorted to subversive plots and activities in a sinister bid to build a religious state in the DPRK while frequenting it under the guise of \"humanitarian aid\" and \"free donation\" over the past 18 years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He confessed to all his crimes in the course of the investigation by the competent organ. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He spoke first at the press conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He illegally entered Pyongyang via Rason City in violation of the DPRK's emergency measure to prevent the spread of Ebola in last February. He is, therefore, under legal investigation by the DPRK's relevant organ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I have so far malignantly defamed the dignity and social system of the DPRK, pursuant to the scenario of the U.S. and the south Korean regime, visiting the DPRK under the signboard of \"humanitarian aid\", \"free donation\" and \"cooperation\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I delivered a \"report on what is going on in north Korea\" before tens of thousands of south Koreans and overseas Koreans at sermon on Sundays at my church and during preaching tours of more than 20 countries including Canada, the U.S., south Korea, Japan and Brazil. Each time I malignantly slandered the dignity and social system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At various kinds of religious meetings including Kimnet, a group of leaders of overseas compatriot church and missionary organization in North America, and the world's south Koreans missionary meeting, I made preachment and gave lectures that \"north Korea should be collapsed with the love of 'God'. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I persistently conducted anti-DPRK missionary activities in a bid to collapse the worship for the leader to be kept in the hearts of the people in the north and disintegrate and destroy it from within.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I made sure that food jutes donated to different parts of the DPRK were intentionally drawn the Cross and used to send them written on church name and bible phrases and clauses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I went round different parts of the DPRK in the name of \"supporting\" in a bid to overturn its social system by taking advantage of the hostile policy against it sought by the south Korean authorities and set up a base for building a religious state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI fanned up distrust and hostility toward the DPRK upon churchmen and the society of compatriots with fabrication and false propaganda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I sent despicable photos he has taken in the DPRK in a secret way to my son. I made sure that my son made opposition literature including video titled \"North's reality\" and briefed on the fact before churchmen and posted it on his website. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I secretly photographed the old bible and hymns of So Kye Ok, Korean living in Los Angels, in around 2007 and committed such fraud that I collected them from people of the DPRK believing in religion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I took active part in the operations of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities to lure and abduct DPRK citizens and in their programs for \"aiding defectors from the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When meeting the U.S. ambassador to Mongolia in 1996 I discussed the issue of helping over 500 \"defectors from the north\" go to south Korea via Mongolia every year. I received a GPS marking an area of the boarder of Inner Mongolia, China from Dennis Kim, south Korean in the U.S., involved in alluring \"defectors from the north\", and handed it to a \"Korean broker defected from the north\" at Beijing Airport.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I made annual outlay for supporting \"defectors from the  north\" from the church budget for two years since 1996 and dispatched Canadian believer Jon Jong Sok to Yanji and Tumen areas in Jilin Province of China to allure DPRK citizens to \"defecting.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rim Hyon Su honestly admitted all crimes perpetrated by him were aimed to overthrow the state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He answered questions raised by reporters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He referred to how he was checked and arrested by a law enforcement organ of the DPRK and laid bare the vicious and hypocritical nature of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces' moves against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to him, the U.S. and south Korean authorities are hurling not only politicians but all tricksters, media and websites into noisy propaganda about the \"nuclear issue of the north\" and the \"human rights issue of the north\". They are terming the DPRK a \"country proliferating WMDs\", \"country suspected of money laundering\" and \"country manufacturing biological weapons\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"report of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the North\" through which the U.S., the south Korean authorities and the West are vociferating about the \"human rights issue of the north\" was cooked up on the basis of false testimonies made by such human scum as Sin Tong Hyok who fled after committing crimes in the north. They bribed \"experts\" on Korean issues and egged them on to let loose a spate of invectives against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allied countries and south Korean authorities are strictly barring goods for civilians, even a gram of food and fertilizers from being exported to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He exposed church organizations and persons engrossed in false propaganda and conspiratorial activities against the DPRK, pursuant to the policies of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces. He deeply repented of his wrongdoings, adding he committed crimes against the DPRK, prompted by his wrong understanding of it."
