            "content": "Kim Jong Un Makes Speech at 9th Congress of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League\r\nPyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- The following is the full text of \"Let Us Usher in a Golden Age of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth Movement\" made by supreme leader Kim Jong Un at the 9th Congress of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League:\n\t\t\t\t\t Dear youth delegates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feeling satisfied that the Ninth Congress of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, which is held in the stirring period when young people across the country are expediting general onward march to implement the decisions of the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, is doing its work successfully, I warmly congratulate all the youth delegates attending this congress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I also extend warm thanks and militant greetings to young people across the country, who are working miracles and feats at the posts of national defence and at the sites of building a powerful socialist country and thus fulfilling their honourable mission and duty as the young vanguard of the Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I congratulate the members of the overseas Korean youth delegations attending the congress, and offer my warm compatriotic greetings to the overseas young compatriots, including those in Japan, and the youth and students in south Korea who are struggling for the independent reunification of their motherland and the prosperity of their nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ninth Congress of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League constitutes a landmark event in defending and adding eternal brilliance to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's idea of and exploits in the youth movement and developing the youth league into invincible vanguard ranks as required by the new era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a reflection of the unanimous wish and desire of young people across the country, the congress has decided to rename the youth league Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League. This is a great event that laid an unshakeable cornerstone for developing the organization of our young people into a youth league of the great leaders for all ages; it is also a source of great honour and happiness for the youth league organizations and young people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a congress of loyalty that has demonstrated the faith and will of the young vanguard to inherit and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the Party's leadership by carrying forward the glorious history and fighting traditions of the youth league, a congress for general onward march that has inspired young people to the grand struggle for building a powerful socialist country, and a historic congress that has set up a new milestone for the victorious advance of the Juche-oriented youth movement and the development of the youth league.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Delegates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As I stand on the platform in the venue of this meaningful congress, a watershed in the development of the Juche-oriented youth movement, I feel my heart filled with infinite gratitude to and reverence for the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who trained our young people to be splendid and reliable successors to the revolution and built the proud youth power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 70 years of the youth league is a history of brilliant victories of the great leaders' original idea of prioritizing young people and their wise leadership. It is also a history of the ardent loyalty and patriotic devotion with which the young people of Korea have supported the Party, the leader, the country and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having made a start of the youth movement early in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution, Comrade Kim Il Sung expounded the Juche-oriented idea of the movement and guided it at its every step, lavishing great trust and affection on young people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By dint of the line of prioritizing young people and his outstanding and seasoned leadership, Comrade Kim Jong Il developed the youth league into an organization that is unfailingly loyal to the Party and the leader and trained young people into reliable successors in carrying forward the lineage of Paektu, into warriors in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, thus opening a new heyday for the youth movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That they regarded prioritizing young people as the most important of all state affairs and made it a strategic revolutionary line in the whole course of leading the revolution, and, by wisely leading the implementation of the line, gave a perfect solution to the youth problem for the first time in history and built a youth power without parallel in the world is an outstanding exploit performed by our great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Indeed, the youth movement of Korea is the glorious Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement pioneered and developed by dint of their great ideas and wise leadership, and ours is Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's youth power built thanks to their ennobling trust and affection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proud decades of victorious advance of the Juche-oriented youth movement are associated with the invaluable blood and sweat and heroic exploits of the young people who fought self-sacrificingly for the Party, the leader, the country and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first generation of the young people of our revolution took up arms following Comrade Kim Il Sung and fought the bloody anti-Japanese struggle, thus achieving the historic cause of national liberation. In the days of the fierce Fatherland Liberation War young people fought under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il Sung, dedicating even their youthful life without hesitation for their dear motherland, thus creating a miracle of heroic Korea in achieving victory in the war and defending with honour their motherland against the imperialists' aggression. In the arduous postwar days our young people, who were faithful to the call of the Party and the leader, performed brilliant feats of labour in reconstruction, and stormed ahead in the spirit of Chollima, thus working a miracle of heroic Korea of building in a short period a socialist state that is independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the trying days of the anti-imperialist, anti-US showdown that would decide the destiny of socialism, our young people stood in the vanguard of supporting the Songun-based revolutionary leadership of General Kim Jong Il, thus safeguarding the lifeline of the Juche revolution and socialist country death-defyingly, overcoming the hardships and trials and opening an era of making a turn in building a powerful socialist country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the new era of the Juche revolution our young people, with the faith and courage that they can lift even the earth when they are trusted by the Party, built the marvellous Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station through a fierce struggle with nature, thus creating the legendary tale of heroic youth and demonstrating to the full the heroic mettle of the young vanguard of the new generation educated and trained by our Party. The Paektusan hero youth spirit displayed by the Paektu youth is the revolutionary spirit of defending the Party Central Committee and implementing its policies to the death and the offensive-oriented, revolutionary spirit symbolic of our present era. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their heroic struggle for and exploits in steadfastly defending the Party, the leader and the country and powerfully propelling socialist construction through generations on the sacred revolutionary road will shine for ever in the annals of our Party and of building the Juche-oriented youth power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the gigantic and worthwhile struggle for achieving the country's prosperity and people's happiness, our young people have been educated in a revolutionary way and trained spiritually and physically, and have developed into a large, matchless contingent forming a thousand-fold, tens-of-thousand-fold fortress around the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our young people are patriots and heroes whom we can be proud of before the world; that they have a large contingent of such trustworthy young people is a great blessing for the Workers' Party of Korea and a source of pride for Korea, and this assures the great strength of our dignified state and its bright future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I pay tribute to the young people of the preceding generations, who dedicated their one and only valuable youth to the sacred cause for the Party, the revolution, the country and the people, and extend once again, on behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, warm, militant greetings to the young people across the country, who are performing shining youthful exploits in translating the Party's plans and intentions into reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Delegates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the youth league is faced with the heavy yet honourable task for ushering in a golden age of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement by developing itself into the eternal youth organization of the great leaders as required by the new era of the Juche revolution and displaying its might as the Party's advance force and wing in the efforts for implementing the decisions adopted at the Seventh Congress of the Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the youth league is to fulfil the sacred mission and duty it has assumed for the times and the revolution, it should model itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Modelling the youth league on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism means holding up the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as eternal leaders and advancing the Juche-oriented youth movement victoriously guided by their revolutionary ideology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a mature demand of our developing revolution and youth movement which have reached a new high, and the militant banner the youth league must hold fast to in the struggle to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young people are the successors to the Juche revolution, and the youth league is a reliable reserve force of our Party. The future of the Party and revolution and the destiny of the country and nation depend largely on the role they play, and the youth league shoulders an important task to perform in implementing our Party's programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great General Kim Jong Il said early that the youth league, together with the Party and the army, has an important role to play in the revolutionary struggle, and that we have nothing to fear if the Party, the army and the youth league are strong. When the youth league, together with the Party and the army, is modelled on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism true to the General's ideas on the Party, the army and the youth league, the might of our revolutionary ranks will be increased to the maximum. Modelling the entire youth league as well as the entire Party and the entire army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the path our revolution should follow and the basic guarantee for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league should safeguard and add brilliance to the great leaders' idea of and leadership exploits in the youth movement, and establish the Party's unified leadership system within itself thoroughly, holding aloft the banner of modelling itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should ensure that all its officials and other young people devote loyalty of the highest degree to upholding Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as eternal leaders. It should take the great leaders' idea of the youth movement as the banner of victory for the youth movement, a fundamental guideline for strengthening itself, and should ensure that all its undertakings are geared to safeguarding the leaders' idea and leadership exploits and death-defyingly implementing the instructions they gave in their lifetime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should constantly intensify the work of establishing the Party's unified leadership system as demanded by the period of making a leap forward in implementing the revolutionary cause of Juche, and establish strict discipline and order whereby all matters arising in its building and activities are dealt with according to the unified conclusion of the Party Central Committee and the Party's decisions and directives are conveyed and disseminated in time from its Central Committee to its lowest echelons and carried out immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should hold fast to ideological education among young people as its main task and fully prepare all of them as genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league is an organization for ideological education, and its basic duty is to conduct ideological education of young people. If the youth league organizations neglect their basic duty of conducting ideological education of their members, busying themselves with ceremonial events or economic and other business-like affairs, they cannot prepare young people to be stout successors to the revolution. This will result in shaking the foundation of the youth work and making the youth league itself inviable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ultimate objective in educating young people is to train all of them into genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party's revolutionary ideology and the revolutionary spirit of Paektu provide essential nourishment for doing so. The youth league should implant the Juche idea, our Party's revolutionary ideology, and the revolutionary spirit of Paektu deep in the minds of all our young people. By doing so, it should train them to be strong in ideas and faith and ready to fight staunchly in the spirit of self-development with loyalty to the Party's cause, and ensure that all the places where they live and work seethe with the soul and mettle of Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league organizations at all levels should hold fast to the five-point education put forward by the Party, regarding it as what constitutes the major contents of the ideological education geared to training young people into Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists, and conduct it effectively by making use of all forms and occasions of the ideological education work. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should lay great stress on educating young people in the greatness of our leaders with the aim of preparing them as the young vanguard unfailingly faithful to the Party and the leaders. They should also step up education of young people in Kim Jong Il's patriotism, revolutionary faith, anti-imperialist and class consciousness, and socialist morality, so that all of them become true patriots with ardent love for their country, hot-blooded fighters with indomitable revolutionary faith and unwavering anti-imperialist and class consciousness, staunch champions of the class struggle and cultured social beings with a high degree of cultural attainments and ennobling moral traits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should effectively run the education system including study sessions and lectures and raise its efficiency to the highest possible level. In this way they can make sure that wherever there are young people, the Party's intentions are given uninterrupted publicity and they imbibe our Party's revolutionary ideology all the time, just as they breathe fresh air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should conduct education of young people in a novel and aggressive way as suited to their characteristic features. They should decisively eliminate the tendency towards emphasizing how many times the ideological education work is done or following any set formula in conducting it. Instead, they should adopt a novel, energetic and militant approach towards this work, in conformity with the characteristics of young people and the requirements of the times. They should strive hard to find and use sincere and highly effective methods of education that will inspire the masses of young people with youthful vigour. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league organizations and young people should become the vanguard and shock brigade in building a powerful socialist country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To build a powerful socialist country is a sacred cause of developing the country into a mighty socialist state, a prospering people's paradise, according to the plans of the great leaders and the Party. To achieve breakthroughs in the vanguard of the struggle to this end is the basic duty proper to our young people who make up the Party's militant reserve and the most vigorous of our social forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All our young people, upholding the militant tasks advanced by the Seventh Congress of the Party, should honour their valuable title of heroic youth in our era, in the worthwhile struggle to build a powerful socialist country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Let us fully demonstrate the resourcefulness and gallantry of the heroic youth in the general offensive for building a powerful socialist country!\"-this is the militant slogan the youth league and young people should hold high in the present times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young people should be the death-defying corps in the struggle to defend their socialist country, faithfully supporting our Party's Songun-based revolutionary leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are the advance force in carrying out the Songun revolution and the main force in safeguarding the country. All of them, bearing in mind our Party's idea of prioritizing arms, should regard national defence as their most sacred duty and the highest expression of patriotism, and valiantly turn out in the struggle to defend the socialist country. The young service personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, as befit the combatants defending the outposts of the anti-imperialist military front, the lifeline of our revolution, should firmly grasp the weapons of the revolution and the class and safeguard the defence lines of the country and its socialist system. At any time in the future we will surely confront the US imperialists, the sworn enemy of our people; they should create a new miracle of achieving victory in this life-or-death showdown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Youth and students should all cultivate ardent patriotism and a staunch spirit of defending the country, and take part in military training with a sincere attitude. In times of emergency they should take up arms and turn out as one in the all-people resistance to defend their beloved country, native homes and workplaces against the aggression of the enemy and their destructive and subversive moves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle to defend socialism is a military showdown with the enemy; at the same time it is a confrontation in ideology and spirit. Today imperialists and reactionaries, setting our young people of a new generation as their target, are resorting to vicious schemes in trying to deprave and corrupt them and undermine our socialism from within.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll our young people should resolutely counter the enemy's schemes for ideological and cultural infiltration with great ideological and mental strength and unshakeable revolutionary faith, and take a tough stand to prevent any alien ideology and culture and unnatural lifestyle from penetrating our interior. The youth league organizations should intensify ideological education and ideological struggle among young people, so as to root out, at the first signs, any poisonous elements of non-socialist and alien practices appearing in the garden of our style of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our country, now developing by leaps and bounds, calls on young people to strive for the building of a powerful socialist country. The vibrant sites where the Mallima speed is being created in a race against time, are theatres of activity for our hot-blooded young people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should uphold the self-development-first banner on all fronts for building a powerful socialist country and display their valiant offensive spirit and youthful courage in achieving new miraculous and innovative successes one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In implementing the Five-Year Strategy for National Economic Development they should raise fierce flames for collective competition, thereby setting new standards and new records and overfulfilling their daily, monthly and quarterly quotas for the national economic plan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league organizations should push ahead with the Songun Youth Torch Prize movement, the youth shock brigade movement and other mass movements, the advantages and vitality of which have been confirmed in practice. They should launch vigorous campaigns in which one overtakes and learns from others and swaps experiences with them, and raise fierce flames for performing great exploits. Then new miraculous and innovative achievements will be made wherever young people are working, and youthful vigour will pervade the entire country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league should carry out with credit major construction projects that will make a significant contribution to developing the economy and improving the people's living standards, fully demonstrating the might of youth shock brigade. The Party Central Committee is planning to place the youth shock brigades, along with the construction units of the People's Army, in the vanguard of the struggle to usher in a great golden age of construction. Young people should display the courage and spirit of moving mountains and filling up seas at a go at the sites of grand socialist construction in answer to the Party's appeal, building on this land larger numbers of monumental structures that are named in honour of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more vigorously young people advance in response to the Party's call demonstrating the might of the youth construction units, the more vibrantly the entire country will be seething and the greater progress will be made in implementing the cause of building a powerful socialist country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young people should become the vanguard and pioneer in building a sci-tech power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present era of science and technology the competition of national strength is precisely the one of science and technology, and the future of our prosperous country depends on how hard our young people are striving, who are sensitive to the new and overflowing with creative wisdom and verve. They should stand in the vanguard of the competitions of the mind and of technologies to build a sci-tech power and glorify the days of their youth with valuable creations and feats, so as to bring forward the future of their prosperous country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young scientists and technicians, keeping their feet firmly planted on this land and looking out over the world, should devote their creative wisdom and enthusiasm to the campaign to surpass the cutting edge, with a view to raising our country to the status of a sci-tech power as soon as possible. Young people should take the lead in making all the people well-versed in science and technology, and become masters of invention and technical innovation, rendering a positive contribution to modernizing the production lines and ensuring the domestic production of raw materials, fuel and equipment. Students should learn hard and accumulate knowledge, always holding books in their hands, and thus prepare themselves to contribute to promoting national prosperity by developing cutting-edge science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYoung people should become creators of socialist civilization and the vanguard in building a civilized power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should play the core, vanguard role in building our country into a civilized socialist power as soon as possible by developing art and literature, sports and all other sectors of socialist culture in a comprehensive way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All of them, cherishing national pride and self-confidence that our own culture and lifestyle are the best, should hold dear all tangible and intangible heritage achieved by the preceding generations, and add lustre to our style of socialist culture. As demanded by the era when the general offensive for building a powerful socialist country is gaining momentum, they should bring the culture of heroic youth into full blossom and make the songs of revolution and struggle resound wherever they live and work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should make strenuous efforts to tighten moral discipline. They should all respect their revolutionary forerunners, teachers and seniors, promote communal unity and family harmony, and observe public morality and order of life on a voluntary basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should contribute to economic construction and defence building with a sturdy physique developed amid the wind of mass-based sports and defence sports, and take the lead in turning the whole country into a socialist fairyland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should wage a proactive struggle to achieve the independent reunification of the country and global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the young people, the sons and daughters of the nation and the future of the country, who ought to stand in the vanguard of the effort to accomplish the great national cause of putting an end to the long-standing suffering of national division and building on this land a dignified and prosperous reunified country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Korean young people in the north, in the south and abroad should hold aloft the banner of national independence and great national unity, join their minds and purposes on the patriotic road of reunification and fight in solidarity and collaboration. In this way, they can smash the obstructive moves of the US imperialists and other anti-reunification forces and open up a broad avenue to national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Holding high the three charters for national reunification, the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, provided by the great leaders, as grand programmes for national reunification, the youth league and young people should stand in the vanguard of the struggle for the independent reunification of the country and render positive support and encouragement to the struggle of the youth and students in south Korea for anti-US independence and national reunification and to the patriotic struggle of the overseas young compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth and students in the south should wage a dynamic struggle to thwart the moves of the United States and its followers for aggression and war, who are attempting to bring a nuclear holocaust to our nation, and to have the historic agreements common to the nation respected and implemented. By doing so, they can open up a new phase for the development of inter-Korean relations and national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those in Japan and other overseas Korean young people should, with pride and self-respect of being members of the dignified Korean nation, render characteristic contributions to the patriotic cause for the independent reunification of their country and prosperity of their socialist motherland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth movement of Korea is closely related to the world youth movement, and the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League is faced with an important task for contributing to securing genuine international justice and realizing the cause of global independence by strengthening unity and cooperation under the unfurled banner of anti-imperialist independence with the progressive young peoples of the world, who champion independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league should apply the idea and principles of our Party's foreign policy to cementing anti-imperialist solidarity, friendship and unity with the world's progressive young peoples and proactively contributing to the development of the world youth movement. It should be a good example and the vanguard in the struggle of the young peoples to achieve independence and justice, and make dynamic headway, demonstrating to the whole world the might of the Juche-oriented youth power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to usher in a golden age in the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement, the youth league should strengthen its organizations and enhance their militant functions and role in every way possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league is a political organization that trains young people to be a reserve force of the Party and successors to the revolutionary cause of Juche; it is in direct charge of the youth movement. Only when its organizations are powerful and their militant might is displayed to the full can they advance the youth movement vigorously true to the Party's ideas and intentions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should launch a strong drive for strengthening its organizations so as to ensure that its organizations at all levels are developed into those strong in organization, discipline, unity and fighting capability, into elite youth ranks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A revolutionary work system and discipline should be established across the youth league organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should establish a well-regulated work system and order by which its organizations at all levels carry out its decisions and directives for implementing the Party's policies and report the results promptly and organizations at higher echelons keep up-to-date with the activities of their subordinate ones and take appropriate measures. It should establish strict discipline across itself, from its Central Committee down to its primary organizations, by which all their undertakings are conducted as required by the Party's policies and the Rules of the youth league.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The major link in the whole chain of the efforts for developing the youth league is to strengthen its primary organizations, which are its grass-roots organizations and basic combat units. The youth league committees at all levels should go down to the primary organizations on a regular basis, improve the qualifications and capabilities of the primary officials and help them in a responsible way so that the officials can work with the youth league members effectively. In particular, city and county youth league committees, the guidance units at the lowest level, should properly get acquainted with the work of their primary organizations, effectively guide them and give them positive help.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Youth league organizations should intensify the organizational life of their members so as to ensure that this life is turned into a course of a school in which they are educated and trained in a revolutionary way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The organizational life in the youth league is worthwhile and valuable political life for young people to add lustre to their political integrity as befits the members of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league organizations should establish a revolutionary climate of organizational life among their members, so as to encourage them all to treasure their organizations as a parent body of their political integrity and take a voluntary part in their organizational life. They should put the organizational life on a regular footing and establish strict organizational discipline to ensure that no young men and women take part in their organizational life lackadaisically or live divorced from their organizations. They should bring the organizational life close to fulfilling revolutionary tasks, ensuring that the outcome of the former is expressed in the latter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league should direct great efforts to strengthening the organizations of the Children's Union, its successor, and educating the union members properly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Children's Union members are pillars who will shoulder the future of our country, and strengthening the Children's Union is an important task entrusted to the youth league.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the enemy fear most is that the lineage of our revolution is being steadily carried forward. Youth league committees at all levels should regard guidance over the work of the Children's Union as one of their tasks, and ensure that school education, family education and social education are closely linked for educating the Children's Union members. In this way they can prepare all the members and organizations of the Children's Union to be the children's vanguard faithful to our Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to build up the ranks of the youth league officials and further enhance their sense of responsibility and role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether or not the work of the youth league is correctly carried on as intended by the Party depends entirely on the role of officials of the youth league, masters of youth work. When they become the engine and skilful political workers that guide young people to always advance straight ahead and with vigour following the Party, the five-million-strong youth ranks can become a steel-like vanguard unit without any duds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth league, to suit the realities in which one generation of its officials is continuously being replaced by another, should replenish and renew in time these ranks with the hard-core young people who are politically and ideologically sound and have been trained in the practical struggle. It should channel great efforts into training its reserve officials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the youth league officials should be well aware of their tasks in the struggle to usher in a golden age of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement, and execute them creditably.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should become fervent advocates, active disseminators and thorough implementers of the great leaders' and Party's idea and line of prioritizing young people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should equip themselves fully with this idea and line, carry on youth work on the basis of the leaders' instructions and the Party's idea, and implement the Party's policy of youth work to the death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should become dedicated fighters, infinite enthusiasts and persevering men of action, who are ready to devote heart and soul to developing the work of the youth league.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should always have the development of the league's work under their consideration and devote their wisdom and passion to achieving it, and organize and carry on the work in a fresh and innovative way with unyielding fortitude and enterprising work style. They should arrange all undertakings in a way big enough to make the youthful hearts beat high, and whatever they do, they should give a strong push to it with unshakeable courage and stamina that they will finish it, come what may, and bring it to fruition without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should become the standard-bearers in the struggle, standing in the vanguard of the ranks to make breakthroughs on the advance, and models of rank-and-file members in all aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should immerse themselves in the seething workplaces, tackle difficult and labour-consuming work ahead of others, and influence their members in practice, not in words, to arouse them to struggle and achieve feats. They should be a good example for the members to emulate in implementing the revolutionary tasks and conducting the organizational life, and be simple, modest and upright in everyday life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should become dear \"elder brothers\" and \"elder sisters\" of the members who love and look after them as they would do their own flesh and blood and share weal and woe with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With fervent comradeship, they should take responsible care of the political integrity of their members and share sorrow and joy with them. They should work devotedly and selflessly for the good of their members and help and lead all of them to advance straight ahead following the Party without any laggard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should be all-round and versatile men, who know much and are possessed of high organizing ability, vigour of activity and rich cultural attainments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By studying hard and by making strenuous efforts they should acquire knowledge in various fields, become proficient in the practical work of the youth league, and acquire the methods and best way of educating and enlisting the members. They should be good at singing, dancing and making motivational speeches. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Party guidance over the work of the youth league should be further improved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The work with young people is part of Party work, and positively helping the youth league in its work and leading it along the right path is an important task of the organizations and officials of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bear in mind the intention of the Party Central Committee to prioritize the work with young people and intensify their policy-oriented guidance and political leadership in order to ensure that the work of the youth league in their respective regions and units is conducted properly in line with the Party's ideas and intentions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should spare no efforts for the education of young people, love and treat them in an unbiased manner with scrupulous maternal affection, and take good care of them in their work and life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Particular concern should be directed to the work with the youth league officials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The organizations and officials of the Party should educate them in a responsible way and provide them with good working conditions so that they can focus on the work with young people. They should admit exemplary youth league officials into the Party and appoint them as Party officials on a preferential basis, so as to ensure that all the officials of the youth league feel great honour and pride and devote all their wisdom and passion to its work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A Party-wide campaign should be launched to create model, exemplary units in Party guidance over the work of the youth league and generalize their experience so as to make sure that loving young people and rendering positive support to the work of the youth league becomes a trait of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The climate of prioritizing and loving young people should pervade the whole country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The work with youth and children is an undertaking of overriding importance that has a bearing on the future of our Party, our state and our style of socialism, and training them should be the concern of the whole country and all the people. Not only Party officials but all other officials and working people should become educators and parents of youth and children, properly educating them and actively assisting in resolving the problems concerning the work with them. Then our young people of a new generation will grow into dependable successors to the revolution under the guidance and with the help of the whole country and the whole society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Delegates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A broad vista is open before the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League and our young people storming ahead along the course of the Korean revolution indicated by the Party Central Committee, and the eternal brilliant future of the youth movement of Korea is assured.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us all struggle dynamically for the accomplishment of the Juche-oriented socialist cause, for the modelling of the youth league on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and towards the bright future of the youth power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Glory to our resourceful, heroic and trustworthy five-million-strong young vanguard!"

Bajo su direccion los jovenes dieron sin vacilacion la juventud y la vida en defensa de la amada nacion durante la enconada Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria, protagonizando asi la leyenda de la victoria de la Corea heroica y defendiendo con honor al pais de la agresion imperialista. Fieles al llamamiento del Partido y el Lider, en los dificiles dias posbelicos realizaron brillantes hazanas laborales en la reconstruccion y, al correr a galope de Chollima (caballo legendario que cubre al dia una distancia de 400 kilometros ?N.T.), obraron el milagro de la Corea heroica de levantar en un corto plazo un Estado socialista politica, economica y militarmente independiente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el arduo periodo de la confrontacion con el imperialismo y EE.UU. en que se decidia el destino del socialismo, defendieron resueltamente el linaje de la revolucion jucheana y la patria socialista, fieles como nadie a la direccion de la revolucion mediante el Songun por el gran General Kim Jong Il, y al superar las pruebas y dificultades abrieron una epoca de viraje para la edificacion de la potencia socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la nueva era de la revolucion jucheana, crearon una leyenda de la juventud heroica al levantar exitosamente la Central Hidroelectrica Heroes Jovenes Paektusan al cabo de una enconada batalla contra los rigores de la naturaleza, con la inquebrantable conviccion de que con la confianza del Partido se puede levantar incluso la Tierra, y de esta manera demostraron sin reservas el temple heroico de los jovenes vanguardias de la nueva generacion formados por el Partido. El espiritu de los heroes jovenes del monte Paektu es un espiritu revolucionario caracterizado por la defensa a ultranza del Comite Central del Partido y la materializacion cabal de su politica, un espiritu de ataque que simboliza la epoca actual. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResplandeceran eternamente en la historia del Partido y de la construccion de la potencia juvenil la lucha heroica y los meritos de los jovenes, quienes en el sagrado trayecto de la revolucion recorrido por distintas generaciones han salvaguardado resueltamente al Partido, el lider y la patria y han impulsado energicamente la construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la grandiosa y enorgullecedora lucha por el fortalecimiento y la prosperidad de la patria y el bienestar del pueblo, los jovenes constituyen un ejercito indestructible, educado con principios revolucionarios, forjado fisica y espiritualmente y que defiende al Partido como un bastion inexpugnable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos nuestros son jovenes patrioticos y heroicos que yo quisiera ensalzar alto para la envidia del mundo.

Y he aqui el poderio y el luminoso futuro de nuestro Estado prestigioso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRindo tributo a los jovenes de la vieja generacion que sin ningun titubeo dieron la valiosa e insustituible juventud a la sagrada causa por el Partido, la revolucion, la patria y el pueblo. Asimismo, en nombre del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, extiendo una vez mas mis cordiales saludos militantes a todos los jovenes del pais que continuan realizando proezas resplandecientes como estrellas en su afan de materializar las ideas y los propositos del Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros delegados:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy la Union de la Juventud tiene por delante la importante y honrosa tarea de convertirse en una agrupacion eternamente de los grandes Lideres de acuerdo con las exigencias de la nueva era de la revolucion jucheana, demostrar plenamente sus potencialidades como unidad de avanzada y de flanco en el empeno por materializar la resolucion del VII Congreso del Partido, y asi abrir una era del maximo esplendor para el movimiento de la juventud kimilsungista-kimjongilista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara cumplir satisfactoriamente la honrosa mision y tarea que asume ante la epoca y la revolucion, la Union debe identificarse enteramente con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significa enaltecer a los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il como eternos Lideres y, teniendo como directrices sus ideas revolucionarias, lograr el avance victorioso del movimiento de la juventud jucheano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un requerimiento apremiante del desarrollo de nuestra revolucion y movimiento juvenil en una etapa superior y la bandera de lucha que la Union debe enarbolar en la tarea de culminar la causa revolucionaria jucheana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes son continuadores de la revolucion jucheana y la Union de la Juventud es la reserva fidedigna de nuestro Partido. El porvenir del Partido y la revolucion y el destino de la patria y la nacion dependen en gran medida del papel de los jovenes y es muy importante la tarea que asume la Union para realizar el programa de la identificacion de toda la sociedad con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo, presentado por el Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTempranamente, el gran General senalo que en la lucha revolucionaria desempena el papel importante la Union de la Juventud, junto con el Partido y el ejercito y que si son fuertes el Partido, el ejercito y la Union de la Juventud, no tenemos por que temerle a nadie en el mundo. Si materializamos la idea del General sobre el Partido, el ejercito y la juventud e identificamos con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo tanto el conjunto del Partido y el ejercito como toda la Union de la Juventud, el poderio de nuestras filas revolucionarias se multiplicara cien y mil veces. Esta tarea es el camino a seguir por nuestra revolucion y la garantia principal de la culminacion de la causa revolucionaria jucheana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la Union de la Juventud le corresponde preservar y perpetuar las ideas y las proezas de direccion de los grandes Lideres sobre el movimiento juvenil, enarbolando su identificacion con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo, y establecer estrictamente en su seno el sistema de direccion unica del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOrientara a todos sus funcionarios y miembros a que consagren toda su lealtad a la labor de enaltecer a Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il como eternos Lideres. Teniendo la idea de estos como bandera victoriosa del movimiento juvenil y guia fundamental para el fortalecimiento de la Union, subordinara todas las labores al objetivo de defender las ideas y las hazanas de los Lideres y materializar a toda costa sus legados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl perseverar en la tarea de establecer el sistema de direccion unica del Partido en atencion a la exigencia de la etapa en que se dan saltos en el logro de la causa revolucionaria jucheana, debe implantar una ferrea disciplina y orden que permitan tratar todos los asuntos referentes a su construccion y actividades ateniendose solamente a las conclusiones del CC del Partido, poner oportunamente a su CC e instancias de base al tanto de las resoluciones e instrucciones del Partido,  de modo que las mismas se ejecuten inmediata y cabalmente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe compete asumir como tarea fundamental la educacion ideologica de sus miembros y preparar a todos ellos como autenticos kimilsungista-kimjongilistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Union de la Juventud es una agrupacion de la educacion ideologica y por tanto es su tarea principal educar ideologicamente a los jovenes. Si ella descuida la educacion ideologica de sus miembros, ocupandose solamente de los actos politicos y de las actividades economicas y profesionales, no podra prepararlos firmemente como continuadores de la causa revolucionaria, hara estremecer el cimiento de la labor con la juventud y se convertira en una agrupacion inactiva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa meta final de la educacion juvenil es formar a todos los jovenes como genuinos kimilsungista-kimjongilistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl nutriente que los forma como tales es la idea revolucionaria de nuestro Partido y el espiritu revolucionario del Paektu. A la Union le atane inculcarles a todos los jovenes la idea Juche, idea revolucionaria del Partido, y el espiritu revolucionario del Paektu para formarlos como poseedores de firme ideologia y fe y como combatientes capaces de fortalecerse a si mismos, fieles a la causa del Partido, y lograr que dondequiera que viven y trabajan los jovenes predominen el espiritu y el temple del Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las organizaciones de todas las instancias de la Union de la Juventud les compete tomar la educacion en los cinco puntos presentada por el Partido como contenido esencial de la educacion ideologica encaminada a formar a los jovenes como kimilsungista-kimjongilistas y realizarla eficientemente a traves de todas las formas de la educacion ideologica y en todas las ocasiones disponibles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes corresponde poner un gran empeno en la educacion en la grandeza de nuestros Lideres, de manera que los jovenes se preparen como vanguardias ilimitadamente fieles al Partido y el lider. Se intensificara entre los jovenes la educacion en el patriotismo de Kim Jong Il, en la conviccion, en el antimperialismo y las clases y en la moral, para que todos ellos se formen como fervorosos patriotas, fogosos combatientes y fieras en la lucha clasista con inflexible fe revolucionaria y clara conciencia antimperialista y clasista, y seres sociales civilizados dotados de elevados conocimientos culturales y nobles rasgos morales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes atane lograr el eficiente funcionamiento y el maximo rendimiento del sistema educativo, incluidos el estudio y la conferencia, de modo que la voz del Partido se escuche sin cesar dondequiera que haya los jovenes y que estos asimilen las ideas revolucionarias del Partido, como el hombre aspira siempre el aire puro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario educar a los jovenes de una manera apropiada, con originalidad y como una ofensiva. Erradicaran decisivamente la tendencia a preocuparse solamente de las veces de la educacion ideologica y a realizarla de forma estereotipada e imprimiran en ella la originalidad, el vigor y la combatividad, acorde con las peculiaridades de la juventud y la demanda de la epoca. Estudiaran y aplicaran activamente veridicos y eficaces metodos de educacion que puedan conmover y apasionar a las masas juveniles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones y los miembros de la Union de la Juventud deben ser vanguardias y brigadas de choque en la construccion de la potencia socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta construccion es una sagrada obra dirigida a levantar en el suelo patrio un poderoso Estado socialista, un paraiso del pueblo, en respuesta al proposito de los grandes Lideres y del Partido. Ser abanderado en esa causa es un deber de los jovenes, reserva del Partido para el combate y unidad mas dinamica de nuestra sociedad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los jovenes honraran mas su preciada condicion como heroes de nuestra epoca en el dignificante esfuerzo por levantar una potencia socialista, en fiel acato a las tareas combativas presentadas por el VII Congreso del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Demostremos sin reservas el ingenio y coraje de los jovenes heroicos en el asalto general por la construccion de la potencia socialista!, esta es la consigna de lucha que deben enarbolar hoy la Union de la Juventud y sus miembros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes deben salvaguardar la patria socialista aun a costa de la vida, siguiendo la direccion de la revolucion Songun de nuestro Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon una patrulla de la revolucion Songun y el destacamento principal para la defensa de la patria. Grabando en lo hondo del corazon la idea del Partido de dar importancia a las armas, consideraran la defensa nacional como el deber mas sagrado y suprema  expresion del patriotismo, y con la firme decision se sumaran a la defensa de la patria socialista. Como soldados de la avanzada que defienden el frente militar antimperialista que constituye la mas importante via respiratoria de nuestra revolucion, los militares jovenes del Ejercito Popular y el Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo deben defender como muralla inexpugnable la linea de defensa de la patria y el regimen socialista, empunando firmemente el fusil de la revolucion, el de la clase, y crear un nuevo mito de la victoria en el combate decisivo contra el imperialismo norteamericano, enemigo jurado de nuestro pueblo con quien este debe saldar las cuentas mas tarde o mas temprano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImbuidos del ardiente patriotismo y firme espiritu de defensa de la patria, todos los jovenes y estudiantes participaran a conciencia en los ejercicios militares, se sumaran como un solo hombre a la resistencia general con el fusil en la mano durante la emergencia y asi defenderan fidedignamente la querida patria, tierra natal y centro de trabajo de la agresion y los actos subversivos y de sabotaje del enemigo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa defensa del socialismo es un enfrentamiento militar, y al mismo tiempo ideologico y espiritual, con el enemigo. Hoy en dia los imperialistas y demas reaccionarios tienen como blancos a las jovenes generaciones y actuan sanudamente para pervertirlas y asi corromper y desintegrar a nuestro socialismo desde adentro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo poseedores del gran potencial ideologico y espiritual y de la conviccion revolucionaria, todos los jovenes mantendran una actitud intransigente contra la penetracion ideologica y cultural del enemigo y trataran de que jamas se introduzcan en nuestro seno las ideas y culturas extranas y el modo de vida degenerado. A las organizaciones de la Union de la Juventud les compete intensificar entre sus miembros la educacion y la batalla ideologicas a fin de arrancar de raiz los brotes de la hierba venenosa, ajena al socialismo y espuria, que germinan en el jardin de nuestro socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el actual proceso de saltos deslumbrantes, nuestra patria convoca a los jovenes a la construccion de la potencia socialista. Los lugares de construccion donde el tiempo se acorta con la velocidad de Mallima (caballo legendario que corre al dia 4 mil kilometros ?N.T.) son escenarios de la juventud apasionada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todos los lugares de la construccion de la potencia socialista, los jovenes deben enarbolar el lema de fortalecernos con los medios propios y protagonizar sucesivamente nuevos actos admirables e innovaciones con el intrepido espiritu de ataque y el vigor que los caracteriza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes atane establecer nuevos patrones y records al fomentar la emulacion colectiva destinada a cumplir la estrategia quinquenal para el desarrollo de la economia nacional y sobrecumplir el plan de cada dia, mes y trimestre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones de la Union de la Juventud promoveran los movimientos masivos como el Movimiento para el Premio Antorcha Juventud del Songun y el de la Brigada de Choque Juvenil, que tienen comprobadas en la practica su ventaja y vitalidad. Fomentaran los movimientos para adelantar a otros, aprender de ellos e intercambiar experiencias y avivaran el afan de realizar hazanas, a fin de imprimir nuevos prodigios e innovaciones en todos los lugares donde trabajan los jovenes y animar a todo el pais con el protagonismo de la juventud. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Union de la Juventud se encargara de las obras de suma importancia para el desarrollo economico y la mejora de la vida del pueblo y las concluira exitosamente, demostrando plenamente el poderio de las brigadas de choque juveniles. El CC del Partido preve abrir una era de gran prosperidad de la construccion colocando a la cabeza a esas brigadas, junto con las unidades de construccion del Ejercito Popular. Con la audaz determinacion de mover cielo y tierra de un aliento, los jovenes erigiran mas obras monumentales denominadas “juventud” en los lugares de la construccion socialista a donde el Partido los convoca. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA medida que los jovenes demuestran plenamente las potencialidades de sus unidades de construccion y avanzan con el impetu multiplicado en respuesta al llamamiento del Partido, se animara mas el pais entero y avanzara mas vigorosamente la causa de la construccion de la potencia socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes deben ser vanguardias y precursores en la construccion de una potencia cientifico-tecnica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actual epoca de ciencias y tecnologia, la emulacion del poderio de los paises equivale a la de sus respectivos adelantos cientifico-tecnicos y el futuro de una patria poderosa y prospera se decide por el empeno de los jovenes, sensibles a lo nuevo, creativos y apasionados. Al dignificar cada uno de sus dias con creaciones y hazanas valiosas, en la primera linea de las batallas de caracter intelectual y tecnologico para construir una potencia cientifico-tecnica, anticiparan el futuro de la patria prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMirando hacia el mundo con los pies bien puestos en nuestra tierra, los jovenes cientificos y tecnicos consagraran su creatividad y pasion al desarrollo de la tecnologia de punta encaminado a colocar cuanto antes a nuestro pais entre las potencias cientifico-tecnicas. Deben estar al frente de la tarea de la formacion cientifico-tecnica de todo el pueblo y ser maestros de la invencion e innovacion tecnica, para asi contribuir sustancialmente a la modernizacion de procesos de produccion y obtener en el pais materias primas, combustibles e instalaciones. Hace falta que los jovenes estudiantes aprendan con aplicacion y adquieran los conocimientos sin abandonar los libros ni un momento y se preparen bien para contribuir con la tecnologia de punta a la prosperidad de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes seran artifices de la civilizacion socialista y vanguardias de la construccion de una potencia civilizada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesarrollaran plenamente todos los renglones de la cultura socialista como la literatura, el arte y el deporte, cumpliendo asi el papel medular y de vanguardia en la tarea de convertir cuanto antes a nuestro pais en una potencia socialista civilizada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los jovenes, con el orgullo y la dignidad de que nuestra cultura y modo de vida son los mejores, apreciaran todas las herencias intelectuales y materiales de las viejas generaciones y haran mas grande nuestra cultura socialista. En atencion a la exigencia de la epoca en que se impulsa energicamente el avance general para la construccion de una potencia socialista, lograran que en cualquier lugar donde esten los jovenes florezca plenamente la cultura de la juventud heroica y resuenen las canciones de la revolucion y lucha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUrge empenarse en establecer entre los jovenes un ambiente de observar los principios y las reglas morales. Conduciran a todos los jovenes a que traten con estima a los precursores revolucionarios, respeten a los maestros y los mayores, promuevan la unidad del colectivo y la armonia familiar y observen voluntariamente la etica publica y el orden de la vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl enardecer el fervor por el deporte masivo y el de defensa nacional, los jovenes contribuiran con la robustez fisica a la construccion economica y la defensa nacional y se pondran al frente de la tarea de acondicionar todo el territorio nacional como una maravilla socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben esforzarse con teson para lograr la reunificacion independiente del pais y la independencia del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que los jovenes, hijos e hijas de la nacion y futuro de la patria, tomen la delantera en la gran empresa nacional para poner fin al sufrimiento de la prolongada division nacional y levantar una potencia unificada, digna y prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la bandera de la independencia y la gran unidad nacionales en alto, todos los jovenes del Norte y Sur de Corea y en el extranjero uniran ideas y voluntades y se solidarizaran en la lucha por la reunificacion nacional, neutralizando los obstaculos del imperialismo yanqui y otras fuerzas opositoras y abriendo un ancho camino de la reintegracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl tomar las Tres Cartas de la Reunificacion de la Patria y las historicas Declaraciones Norte-Sur del 15 de Junio y el 4 de Octubre preparadas por los grandes Lideres como grandes programas de la reintegracion nacional, la Union de la Juventud y sus miembros se pondran a la cabeza de la lucha por la reunificacion independiente y apoyaran y respaldaran activamente la lucha contra el imperialismo norteamericano y por la independencia y la reintegracion nacional de los jovenes y estudiantes surcoreanos y el bregar patriotico de los jovenes compatriotas en el ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes y estudiantes surcoreanos frustraran el intento de Estados Unidos y sus seguidores de provocar una guerra con el fin de sumir a la nacion en una hecatombe nuclear y se  esforzaran con denuedo para respetar e implementar los historicos acuerdos comunes de la nacion, creando una nueva coyuntura para el desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas y la reunificacion nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes coreanos residentes en Japon y otros paises, con el gran orgullo y honor de ser miembros de la digna nacion coreana, haran aportes especiales a la empresa patriotica de la reunificacion independiente del pais y el florecimiento y la prosperidad de la patria socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl movimiento juvenil de Corea esta estrechamente relacionado con el del mundo y la Union de la Juventud Kimilsungista-Kimjongilista tiene por delante la importante tarea de promover con la bandera del antimperialismo y la independencia en alto la solidaridad y colaboracion con los jovenes progresistas del mundo que reclaman la independencia y asi contribuir a la autentica justicia internacional y a la causa de la independencia en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl aplicar el ideal y los principios de la politica exterior de nuestro Partido, la Union de la Juventud promovera la solidaridad antimperialista, la amistad y la unidad con los jovenes progresistas del mundo y contribuira activamente al fortalecimiento y desarrollo del movimiento juvenil del planeta. Sera modelo y vanguardia en la lucha de la juventud por la independencia y la justicia y asi pondra de manifiesto el poderio de nuestra potencia juvenil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara abrir una era del maximo esplendor para el movimiento de la juventud kimilsungista-kimjongilista, es indispensable que la Union de la Juventud consolide sus organizaciones y eleve por todos los medios su funcion y papel combativos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Union de la Juventud es una organizacion politica que forma a los jovenes como reservas del Partido y continuadores de la causa revolucionaria del Juche, asi como la encargada directa del movimiento juvenil. Solo cuando sean fuertes sus organizaciones y se manifieste plenamente su poderio combativo, se puede impulsar con dinamismo el movimiento juvenil a tenor de la idea y voluntad del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la Union le corresponde fomentar el fortalecimiento de sus organizaciones y transformarlas en agrupaciones organizadas, disciplinadas, unidas y combativas, en destacamentos juveniles elite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImplantara en su seno un sistema de trabajo y disciplina revolucionario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebe establecer un ordenado sistema y orden de trabajo, de modo que sus organizaciones de todos los niveles cumplan al pie de la letra las resoluciones y directivas de la Union para plasmar las orientaciones del Partido e informen de ello a su debido tiempo y las organizaciones superiores conozcan regularmente de las actividades de las inferiores y tomen medidas pertinentes. Implantara una rigurosa disciplina para que todas sus organizaciones, comenzando por las de nivel central hasta las de base, realicen las labores segun las orientaciones del Partido y el postulado del reglamento estipulado por los estatutos de la Union.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas fundamental para el fortalecimiento de la Union de la Juventud es robustecer las organizaciones primarias que constituyen su base y principal unidad de combate. A los comites a todos los niveles les incumbe bajar regularmente a las organizaciones primarias, elevar el nivel de preparacion y la facultad de desenvolvimiento de sus dirigentes y ayudarlos con responsabilidad, de suerte que estos trabajen sustancialmente con otros miembros. Es de particular importancia que los comites de la juventud en ciudades y distritos, unidades de direccion mas inferiores, controlen y dirijan correctamente las labores de las organizaciones primarias y les brinden una ayuda eficaz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones de la Union de la Juventud intensificaran entre sus miembros la vida organica, de manera que esta sea un curso de la escuela revolucionaria juvenil destinado a educarlos y forjarlos con los principios revolucionarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara los jovenes la vida organica es digna y valiosa, pues les permite continuar su inapreciable existencia politica como miembros de la Union de la Juventud Kimilsungista-Kimjongilista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones de la Union induciran a sus miembros a establecer un ambiente revolucionario de la vida organica, apreciar las organizaciones a las que pertenecen como matrices de su vida politica y participar voluntariamente en las actividades de la Union. Reglamentaran las actividades organicas e implantaran una recia disciplina organica entre los jovenes, con el objetivo de prohibir tajantemente los fenomenos como su insincera participacion en las actividades organicas o su separacion de las mismas. Lograran que las actividades organicas se combinen estrechamente con el cumplimiento de las tareas revolucionarias para que las primeras redunden en el segundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Union debe poner gran empeno en fortalecer su relevo, la Organizacion de Ninos, y educar bien a sus miembros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos integrantes de la organizacion infantil son futuros pilares de nuestro pais y fortalecerla es una tarea importante asignada a la Union.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora los enemigos temen mas que nada a la consecuente sucesion de las generaciones de nuestra revolucion. Los comites juveniles de todos los niveles asumiran como su propia tarea la direccion sobre la organizacion infantil, lograran que la escuela estreche la relacion con la familia y la sociedad en la educacion de los ninos y asi prepararan a todas las organizaciones infantiles y sus miembros como genuina guardia infantil de nuestro Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso estructurar bien las filas de los cuadros juveniles y elevar mas su sentido de responsabilidad y papel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho de que las labores de la Union de la Juventud se realicen correctamente, con arreglo a la voluntad del Partido, depende enteramente de sus ejecutores que son los cuadros de la Union. Si estos se convierten en locomotoras y habiles politicos que orientan a los jovenes a que avancen siempre recto y con vigor en pos del Partido, el contingente de los 5 millones de jovenes se transformara en una vanguardia de acero que no tenga ningun defecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la Union de la Juventud le corresponde suplir y reforzar oportunamente las filas de sus dirigentes con jovenes excelentes, integros politica e ideologicamente y fogueados en la lucha practica, en vista de la realidad en que en esas filas el cambio de las generaciones continua ininterrumpidamente. Prestara gran atencion a la formacion de dirigentes de reserva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBien conscientes de la mision que asumen para abrir una era de pleno esplendor del movimiento de la juventud kimilsungista-kimjongilista, los dirigentes de diferentes niveles de la Union la cumpliran fielmente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeran resueltos defensores, entusiastas divulgadores y consecuentes ejecutores de la idea y linea de los grandes Lideres y del Partido de conceder importancia a la juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlenamente identificados con las mismas, realizaran la labor con los jovenes ateniendose unicamente a las instrucciones de los Lideres y las ideas del Partido y cumpliran a toda costa las orientaciones del Partido relacionadas con las actividades juveniles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLucharan con abnegacion, trabajaran con entusiasmo y realizaran con teson las labores de la organizacion, dedicandose en cuerpo y alma a las mismas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiempre pensaran y movilizaran toda su inteligencia y pasion para el desarrollo de las labores de la Union, asi como organizaran y realizaran las actividades con vigor, actitud emprendedora, originalidad y creatividad. Programaran todas las labores con amplia vision y ambicion juvenil y las impulsaran con una inquebrantable firmeza y la decision de que, una vez que las hayan iniciado, las concluiran  aunque se les venga el cielo abajo, hasta ver los resultados deseados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben ser los abanderados que abren el camino para el ataque y ejemplos de los demas miembros de la Union en todos los aspectos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiempre estaran en los centros de trabajo donde reina el espiritu combativo, seran los primeros en echarse al hombro las faenas dificiles y estimularan a otros miembros a lograr proezas en la lucha con sus ejemplos en la practica y no con palabras. Seran sus paradigmas en el cumplimiento de las tareas y la vida organica y daran muestras de modestia, cortesia y honestidad en la vida cotidiana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmaran y atenderan a los miembros de la Union y compartiran con ellos las alegrias y penas, como si fueran sus hermanos mayores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el calido companerismo se responsabilizaran de su vida politica, la protegeran y conviviran con ellos no solo en los momentos felices sino tambien en los tristes. Les serviran con total entrega y los atenderan y educaran para que todos ellos, sin ninguna excepcion, sigan solamente al Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe prepararan como hombres multifaceticos con amplios conocimientos, gran arte de mando, capacidad de desenvolvimiento y alto nivel cultural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstudiaran con aplicacion y se esforzaran para ser omnisapientes, dominar el trabajo de la Union de la Juventud y asimilar el arte de educar y organizar a sus miembros. Tambien deben saber cantar, bailar y pronunciar discursos de exhortacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso mejorar la direccion del Partido sobre las labores de la Union de la Juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl trabajo con los jovenes es una parte de las labores del Partido y ayudar y orientar la Union de la Juventud en sus actividades constituye uno de los deberes importantes que les incumben a las organizaciones del Partido y sus funcionarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos, conscientes del proposito con que el Comite Central del Partido concede gran importancia a la juventud, intensificaran su direccion mediante la politica y los programas politicos a las organizaciones juveniles de sus respectivas regiones y unidades, de manera que ellas realicen sus labores adhiriendose al pensamiento y voluntad del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPondran mucho empeno en la educacion de los jovenes y los trataran y amaran con imparcialidad como sus madres y atenderan su trabajo y vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario prestar especial atencion a la labor con los dirigentes de la Union de la Juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones del Partido y sus funcionarios se responsabilizaran de su educacion y les aseguraran optimas condiciones para que se consagren con toda dedicacion a sus tareas. Admitiran a los ejemplares en el Partido y los promoveran antes que a otros como funcionarios partidistas para que pongan toda su energia y talento en su trabajo con alto honor y orgullo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todo el Partido crearan ejemplos y prototipos de la direccion partidista sobre las labores de la Union de la Juventud y generalizaran sus experiencias, de modo que amar a los jovenes y apoyar a sus organizaciones sea una cualidad que caracteriza al Partido del Trabajo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que promover en todo el pais la tendencia de amar y apreciar a los jovenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa labor con los jovenes y ninos es una tarea importantisima que decide el futuro de nuestro Partido, Estado y socialismo y formarlos bien es un deber de todo el Estado y pueblo. Tanto los funcionarios del Partido como los de la sociedad y demas trabajadores deben ser educadores y padres que les den buena formacion y resolver sus problemas de modo que las nuevas generaciones se preparen como fidedignas continuadoras de la revolucion bajo la direccion y apoyo de todo el Estado y la sociedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros delegados:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la Union de la Juventud Kimilsungista-Kimjongilista y sus miembros, que corren a toda velocidad por el camino de la revolucion coreana indicado por el CC del Partido, les espera un luminoso porvenir y es muy amplia la perspectiva del movimiento juvenil coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuchemos todos con vigor por la culminacion de la causa socialista del Juche, por la transformacion de la Union de la Juventud segun el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo y por el esplendido futuro de la potencia juvenil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Gloria a los cinco millones de jovenes vanguardias, inteligentes, valientes y fidedignos!"
