            "content": "Kim Jong Un's Letter to Chongryon and Koreans in Japan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- Supreme leader Kim Jong Un on Monday sent a letter \"Let Us Usher In a New Heyday of the Movement of Koreans in Japan True to the Intention of the Great Comrade Kim Jong Il\" to the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Koreans resident in Japan on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of Chongryon's founding.\n\t\t\t\t\t The full text of the letter is as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I feel happy that Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) is greeting the 60th anniversary of its founding in the stirring period when a dynamic struggle is being waged to celebrate the 70th anniversaries of national liberation and founding of the Workers' Party of Korea as grand national events.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the occasion of this anniversary, I extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings to Chongryon officials including Chairman Ho Jong Man and to all other compatriots in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon is a prestigious body of the overseas citizens of our Republic, which the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il formed and led.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proud road travelled by Chongryon bears the imprints of the wise guidance and painstaking efforts of the great leaders, who strengthened and developed Chongryon into a Juche-based overseas compatriots' body that represents the rights and interests of all the Koreans resident in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great Comrade Kim Il Sung was the pioneer of an overseas compatriots' movement in the era of independence, founder of Chongryon and saviour and benevolent father of the Koreans resident in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With an insight into the actual situation of the movement of Koreans in Japan which was wandering at the crossroads of rise and fall in search of  its correct road, the President saved the movement from the crisis by advancing a sagacious policy on the change of its line, and had Chongryon, the first-ever Juche-based overseas compatriots' body, formed. He indicated the road ahead of Chongryon at every stage of the development of the movement of Koreans in Japan, and led with great affection the organization and Koreans resident in Japan to follow the road resplendent with glory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great Comrade Kim Jong Il was an outstanding leader who, true to the President's great idea, developed Chongryon into a pacesetter of patriotism, into a model of patriotic loyalty to the motherland and into a prototype body of overseas compatriots. He was also the saviour of the destiny of Chongryon and the Koreans resident in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He built up the ranks of Chongryon officials into single-heartedly united ranks strong in ideology and faith, and defended the organization on the strength of Songun. Regarding Chongryon as part of the socialist country and the Koreans resident in Japan as his own flesh and blood, he ensured that even in the difficult days, when the country was making the Arduous March, material and spiritual assistance was rendered unsparingly to the development of the national education by Chongryon, the dignity of Koreans in Japan and their stabilized life. Thanks to his trust and warm affection, Chongryon could demonstrate its pride in being a model overseas compatriots' body across the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Indeed, the 60 years of Chongryon is a brilliant history of the idea of Juche-based overseas compatriots' movement put forward by the great leaders and their wise guidance, and a history adorned with legendary tales of their ennobling love for the nation and overseas compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the wise guidance of the peerlessly great men of Mt. Paektu and enjoying their affection, Chongryon has travelled over the past six decades a glorious road of development, and performed great exploits for the motherland and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sharing the destiny of the great leaders and the motherland, it has developed into invincible ranks that fully demonstrate its might of single-hearted unity. In the crucible of the struggle to establish the ideological and leadership system of Juche, it has become a truly Juche-based, patriotic body that regards believing in and following only the great leaders and realizing their intentions and wishes as its inherent duty. Today as a powerful body that has been rallied organizationally and ideologically based on the great Juche idea and that has struck its root deep among the broad sections of the masses of the Koreans resident in Japan, it is forcefully promoting the movement of Koreans in Japan. This is a proud, true feature of Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon is demonstrating its might as a promising body which is invariably carrying forward the baton of patriotic work. In the face of difficult conditions in an alien land, it brings up the children of Korean compatriots into true patriots through its well-knit network of national education ranging from primary school to university, and has trained the hard core of the masses of Korean compatriots of the new generation including the core youth and businesspeople who will add brilliance to the history of the movement of Koreans in Japan, and they are stoutly carrying on the lineage of patriotic devotion. This is a pride of Chongryon and a source of its might.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon has rendered an active contribution to the sacred cause of achieving the prosperity of the socialist DPRK and the reunification of the nation. Its officials and other compatriots in Japan have rendered distinctive services to the prosperity of their motherland out of ardent patriotism, breathing the same air and keeping step with the people in their homeland. With confidence in the veracity of the policies of our Party and the government of the Republic on national reunification, Chongryon has done its best to implement them and contributed to cementing solidarity with the people of Japan and the rest of the world and raising the international profile of the Republic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party and the government of the Republic feel their greatest pride in having Chongryon, a patriotic overseas compatriots' body boundlessly faithful to its leaders, homeland and nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing myself of this opportunity, I offer tribute to Chongryon officials of the elder generations including Han Tok Su and other patriotic compatriots who dedicated all their lives to holding the great leaders in high esteem, organizing Chongryon and strengthening the movement of Koreans in Japan, and extend warm thanks to all the officials of Chongryon and other Korean compatriots in Japan who are devoting all their energy and zeal to accomplishing Chongryon's patriotic cause without seeking any personal fame or reward. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon and Korean compatriots in Japan are now faced with the honourable task of adding glory to the immortal exploits of the great leaders and bringing about a new upsurge in the movement of Koreans in Japan by keeping step with the people in the homeland on a general onward march.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon should do all of its undertakings thoroughly as intended and wished by the great leaders, and usher in a new heyday of the movement of Koreans in Japan true to the General's instructions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should strengthen and develop itself as befits a powerful, Juche-based overseas compatriots' body that shines with the august names of the peerlessly great men of Mt. Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should pay primary concern to establishing the ideological and leadership system of Juche across its organizations and carry on this work without letup. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should hold the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem for ever, and staunchly defend and add eternal brilliance to their idea of building up Chongryon and their undying leadership exploits. It should take their ideology and achievements as the eternal guideline for the movement of Koreans in Japan, and thoroughly implement the instructions they gave Chongryon and the compatriots in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should continue to give priority to consolidating the single-hearted unity of its ranks in every way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the organizations and officials of Chongryon, regarding this unity as the great foundation of the movement of Koreans in Japan, should rally themselves around the central leadership with one mind and purpose, and accomplish its patriotic cause, which was pioneered with comradely unity, by dint of comradeship. Its organizations should keep in mind that the single-hearted unity of the ranks of Chongryon and the warm affection shared by the compatriots are a source of its might and a new heyday of the movement of Koreans in Japan, and make every possible effort to unite the masses of the compatriots rock-solid. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to conduct more dynamically the information and education work aimed at giving full play to the spiritual strength of Chongryon officials and other compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon should concentrate its efforts on the education of its officials and other compatriots in the greatness of the great leaders and Kim Jong Il's patriotism, and make constant efforts to educate them in the Korean-nation-first spirit and in the history and traditions of the movement of Koreans in Japan. In accordance with the changed situation, it should intensify education in faith so that all its officials and other compatriots including the new generation will steadily follow the road which has been travelled by their preceding generations, cherishing in their minds firm belief in the invincibility of their socialist motherland and the validity of the patriotic cause of Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In line with the demands and conditions of the prevailing situation, Chongryon should establish a well-knit information and education system and make strenuous efforts to constantly create new and effective forms and methods of information and motivation work. Mass media, including Joson Sinbo, should increase their appeal by writing and editing their articles in a way that they suit to the characteristics and preparedness of readers. The Kumgangsan Opera Troupe and the song and dance troupes in local areas, as befit Juche-based overseas Korean national art groups developed under the leadership of the leaders, should conduct brisk artistic activities as suited to the emotion and psychology of the compatriots so as to deeply implant the soul of the Korean nation in them and inspire their patriotic enthusiasm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon should build its subordinate organizations into powerful, patriotic ones which have taken root deep among the masses of the compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should strengthen its chapters, branches and other grass-roots organizations into reliable buttresses infused with the love for the homeland and nation. It should direct its efforts to solidifying its chapters, the regional bases of the movement of Koreans in Japan. It should also enliven its branches, the basic units of living for the compatriots, in order to make every place where Koreans live brim over with harmony, unity and love for the country and nation. Chongryon organizations and affiliates at all levels should conduct powerful mass political work among compatriots to rally them in a larger number. By doing so, it can consolidate and continuously expand the mass foundation of the movement of Koreans in Japan. Adhering to the mass line in all types of its work, Chongryon should give top and absolute priority to affording the compatriots convenience in their living and defending and guaranteeing their interests, and solve all problems by relying on their patriotic \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t enthusiasm and creative efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to expand and strengthen its patriotic motive force, Chongryon should channel all its efforts into a campaign to win back the compatriots while promoting it in close combination with various movements to develop national culture, mass-based sports activities, campaign to defend Koreans' rights, and service and welfare activities. By doing so, it should develop the campaign to win back the compatriots into a powerful one that advances forward by the efforts of Koreans, they themselves being its master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should continue to direct strenuous efforts to championing the democratic national rights and interests of Koreans in Japan and to developing national education, work with young people of the new generation and work with businesspeople.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defending and guaranteeing the democratic national rights and interests of the Koreans resident in Japan is the basic mission and duty of Chongryon. Chongryon should make positive efforts to safeguard and expand all the rights our compatriots are entitled to as overseas citizens of a sovereign state, such as the rights to education, business and free travel to their motherland, and staunchly fight against all sorts of discriminative measures and inhumane acts that infringe upon their rights and interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National education is what Chongryon should invariably hold fast to as one of its central tasks. It should direct its main efforts to establishing the Juche orientation in its educational work and thus imparting love for the country and national identity, while improving the contents and methods of education as required by the era of the knowledge-based economy, thus giving play to the advantages and vitality of the democratic national education. Korea University should steadily improve its education level as befits a base for training able personnel for Chongryon, and thus bring up its students into genuine patriots and competent specialists. By doing so, it can exalt its authority and fame as the dignified university of the Republic's overseas citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present situation when the younger generation is emerging in the society of Korean compatriots as the leading force of the patriotic movement of Chongryon, the future of the movement of Koreans in Japan depends on how these young people are brought up. Chongryon should train them into reliable successors who would carry forward the cause of Chongryon, a patriotic legacy bequeathed by the great leaders, invariably whatever the trials. The Korean Youth League in Japan, the Association of Korean Young Men of Commerce in Japan and the Union of Korean Students in Japan should add brilliance to the valuable inheritances the preceding generations achieved, and lead young Korean compatriots to live honourably anytime and anywhere keeping in mind that they are Koreans by origin. The Union of Democratic Korean Women in Japan should intensify its work with the women compatriots of the younger generation so that they can preserve the national identity of the society of Koreans an\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t d carry forward the proud tradition of turning one of the wheels of the patriotic movement of Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Businesspeople, one of the basic sections of the masses under Chongryon and the main force in the movement of Koreans in Japan, should be actively enlisted in the patriotic work of Chongryon. The Federation of Korean Men of Commerce in Japan and other economic organizations should effectively protect and render wholehearted assistance to compatriots in their commercial and business activities, and thus ensure that they conduct their activities with great vigour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By rendering services to hastening the prosperity and development of their socialist motherland and national reunification, Chongryon and our compatriots in Japan should perform the mission and patriotic duty they have assumed for the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should devote their patriotic efforts to the sacred cause of achieving the prosperity of their socialist motherland. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The destiny of our overseas compatriots is linked with that of their motherland; when their motherland becomes strong, the prestige of their organizations and themselves gets enhanced. Chongryon officials and our compatriots in Japan should champion the dignity and prestige of their socialist motherland in every way possible, and contribute to building theirs into a thriving socialist nation, those with strength dedicating their strength, those with knowledge devoting their knowledge and those with money donating their money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should uphold the three charters for national reunification, the June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, and wage the national reunification movement dynamically. Chongryon should strengthen national unity with Koreans affiliated with \"Mindan\" (Federation of \"ROK\" Residents in Japan), and support and encourage the just struggle of their fellow countrymen in south Korea for independence, democracy and national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the ideals of independence, peace and friendship, Chongryon should develop friendly ties with the progressive personages from various strata and other people of Japan so as to create on its own initiative an environment and conditions favourable for its work and the movement of Koreans in Japan and to help promote the DPRK-Japan relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the success in ushering in a new heyday of the movement of Koreans in Japan at present, Chongryon should establish a well-regulated system of its work and improve its guidance methods in keeping with the changed situation and environment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of Chongryon should consistently carry out the tasks discussed and decided on the principle of democratic centralism, and intensify its unified guidance over its subordinate organizations, affiliates and other organs at all levels to ensure that they work in a lively manner and carry out their tasks. The prefectural headquarters of Chongryon should establish discipline and order whereby they carry out the decisions and directives of the Central Committee by relying on collective wisdom, and discharge their responsibility and role as regional leadership units of the movement of Koreans in Japan. The central leadership bodies of the affiliates and other organs of Chongryon should establish a well-regulated system of work in line with their characteristics, and bring guidance and assistance closer to their subordinate units to perform with credit the patriotic work in their respective fields. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to improve the work methods as demanded by the actual situation of Chongryon and the realities of the compatriots' society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By means of innovative insight, fresh style of work and seasoned and experienced methods of work, Chongryon organizations, affiliates and other organs at all levels should create a new spirit, a new feature of the movement of Koreans in Japan that is advancing full of vigour and vitality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether a new heyday of the movement of Koreans in Japan is ushered in or not depends on the role of Chongryon officials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regarding the instructions of the great leaders as guidelines for their work and life, Chongryon officials should always go among the masses of the compatriots and become organizers and motivators who share sweets and bitters with them and enlist their spiritual strength. Maintaining the compatriots-first principle, they should display the spirit of boundless devotion and self-sacrifice for the national rights and happy future of their compatriots in Japan, in order that the latter regard Chongryon as their mother's embrace and sincerely trust, love and rely on it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChongryon is part of the socialist DPRK and the Koreans resident in Japan are brothers and sisters and family members of the motherland. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party and the government of the Republic will take care, on its own responsibility, of the destiny and future of Chongryon and the Koreans resident in Japan that the great President and General bequeathed, and do their best for the development of the movement of Koreans in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I firmly believe that Chongryon officials and all other Korean compatriots in Japan will, in the future, too, throw in their lot with their socialist motherland invariably and fulfil their honourable responsibility and duty in their efforts to usher in a new heyday of the movement of Koreans in Japan."

Ilumino el camino a seguir por ella en cada fase de su desarrollo, amparo en su generoso regazo a ella y a los compatriotas en Japon y los condujo por un trayecto glorioso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran companero Kim Jong Il es el destacado dirigente y defensor del destino de los compatriotas radicados en Japon quien, en respuesta al gran ideal del gran Lider Kim Il Sung, convirtio a la Chongryon en la abanderada del amor al pais y la nacion, paradigma del patriotismo y lealtad y modelo de las organizaciones de compatriotas en el extranjero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFue el quien consolido las filas de los funcionarios de la Chongryon en monoliticas tropas de intransigente idea e inconmovible fe y salvaguardo fidedignamente a la asociacion con el arma omnipotente del Songun (prioridad de los asuntos militares ?N.T.). Considero a ella parte de la patria socialista y a los compatriotas en Japon hermanos consanguineos. Aun durante la Marcha Penosa, periodo dificil para la patria, les brindo una sincera ayuda espiritual y material a favor del desarrollo de la ensenanza nacional, la dignidad y la vida estable de los compatriotas. Gracias a esa muestra de confianza y amor, la Chongryon ha podido hacer gala de su condicion de modelo de las organizaciones de coreanos radicados en distintas latitudes del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe hecho, los seis decenios de la historia de la Chongryon se caracterizan por la original idea de los grandes lideres sobre el movimiento de coreanos en el extranjero y su destacada orientacion, asi como por su benevolencia que representa el noble amor a la nacion y que genera leyendas de afecto a los compatriotas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la sabia orientacion y amor de las grandes figuras del monte Paektu, a lo largo de seis decadas de su historia la Chongryon ha avanzado por un camino empedrado de gloria y ha realizado relevantes proezas para la patria y la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl correr la misma suerte con sus lideres y patria, se ha fortalecido como tropas indestructibles que exhiben sin reservas el poderio de la unidad monolitica. En el fragor de la lucha para establecer en su seno un original sistema de ideologia y direccion, ha crecido como una autentica agrupacion patriotica sustentada en la idea Juche que confia y sigue solamente a los grandes lideres y asume como tarea principal la materializacion de sus propositos y deseos. Hoy demuestra con orgullo su verdadero aspecto al impulsar energicamente el movimiento de los coreanos en Japon como agrupacion poderosa, compactamente unida en lo organico e ideologico sobre la base de la gran idea Juche y profundamente arraigada en las amplias masas de compatriotas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsimismo, demuestra su potencial como organizacion prometedora que hereda invariablemente el patriotismo. Su orgullo y fuerza motriz parten del hecho de que, aun en la dificil condicion que supone vivir en el suelo foraneo, los hijos compatriotas crecen como verdaderos patriotas bajo un ordenado sistema de la educacion nacional que abarca desde la ensenanza primaria hasta la universitaria, que se forma la flor y nata de la sociedad de compatriotas, entre ellos los miembros activos de la juventud y los jovenes comerciantes e industriales, que haran resplandecer la historia del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon, y que todos ellos heredan firmemente el patriotismo y la lealtad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Chongryon ha venido contribuyendo sustancialmente a la sagrada causa por la prosperidad de la patria socialista y la reunificacion nacional. Imbuidos del fervoroso patriotismo, tanto sus cuadros como los demas compatriotas respiran el mismo aire y caminan al compas de los de la patria y han hecho aportes excepcionales a su florecimiento. Convencida de la justeza de la orientacion del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y del Gobierno de la Republica sobre la reintegracion nacional, la Chongryon ha hecho cuanto esta a su alcance para lograrla, asi como ha contribuido a la solidaridad con el pueblo japones y otros del mundo y a elevar el prestigio de la Republica en la arena internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro Partido y gobierno se sienten infinitamente orgullosos de contar con la Chongryon, agrupacion de compatriotas en el extranjero infinitamente fieles a su lider, patria y nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovecho esta ocasion para rendir tributo a Han Tok Su, a otros cuadros de la Chongryon y compatriotas patrioticos de la vieja generacion quienes dieron su vida al enaltecimiento de los grandes lideres, la fundacion de esa asociacion y el desarrollo del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon, asi como para transmitir mi cordial agradecimiento a todos los funcionarios de la Chongryon y los compatriotas en Japon quienes se entregan en cuerpo y alma a la causa patriotica de la agrupacion, sin aspirar a la fama o la remuneracion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy la referida organizacion y los compatriotas en Japon enfrentan la honrosa tarea de hacer valer las sempiternas hazanas de direccion de los grandes lideres, acompasar los pasos con los de la patria en el avance general y asi producir nuevos cambios en el movimiento de los coreanos en Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la Chongryon le corresponde realizar todas las labores segun la intencion y el deseo de los grandes lideres y abrir una nueva era de prosperidad para el movimiento de los coreanos en Japon en acato al legado del gran General.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe incumbe robustecerse como una poderosa y original organizacion de compatriotas en el extranjero que se honra por los respetables nombres de las eminentes figuras del monte Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe atane anteponer a todo lo demas la tarea de establecer el sistema de ideologia y direccion que se nutre de la idea Juche y profundizar en ella ininterrumpidamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Chongryon enaltecera eternamente a los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il, defendera resueltamente sus ideas sobre la construccion de la misma y sus sempiternos meritos de direccion y los perpetuara. Tomara consecuentemente los pensamientos y las proezas de los grandes lideres como eterno programa del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon y cumplira al pie de la letra las instrucciones dadas por ellos a la misma y a los compatriotas en Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte todo, seguira empenandose en fortalecer la unidad monolitica de sus filas en todos los aspectos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las organizaciones e integrantes de la Chongryon la consideraran como primera tarea del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon, se aglutinaran con una misma idea y voluntad en torno a la Direccion Central y culminaran con el potencial del companerismo la causa patriotica iniciada a base de la unidad entre los camaradas. Las organizaciones de la Chongryon, conscientes de que la unidad monolitica de sus filas y la sincera fraternidad entre los compatriotas constituyen la fuerza de la Chongryon y abren la nueva era de prosperidad para el movimiento de los coreanos en Japon, haran cuanto puedan para lograr la inquebrantable unidad de los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso realizar como una ofensiva la propaganda y la educacion encaminadas a poner de manifiesto el potencial espiritual de los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Chongryon se concentrara en educar a los cuadros y otros compatriotas en la grandeza de los lideres y el patriotismo de Kim Jong Il y efectuara constantemente la educacion en la idea de priorizar a la nacion coreana y la propaganda sobre la historia y las tradiciones del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon. En vista del cambio de la situacion, se profundizara en la educacion en la confianza para que todos los cuadros de la Chongryon, las nuevas generaciones y otros compatriotas en Japon se convenzan firmemente de la invencibilidad de la patria socialista y la justeza de la causa patriotica de la Chongryon y lleven adelante invariablemente y con firmeza las tradiciones de amor al pais y la nacion, establecidas por sus antecesores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn atencion a la actual exigencia y circunstancia, establecera un ordenado sistema de propaganda y educacion y aplicara sin cesar eficaces formas y metodos de propaganda y agitacion. En correspondencia a las particularidades y la preparacion de los lectores, popularizaran las publicaciones como Joson Sinbo y elevaran su fuerza de atraccion. Como organizaciones artisticas coreanas en el extranjero que se han desarrollado bajo la atencion de los lideres, el Conjunto Operistico Kumgangsan y otros musico-coreograficos locales realizaran intensas actividades artisticas acordes al sentimiento y la sicologia de los compatriotas, a fin de inculcarles el espiritu de la nacion coreana y enardecer su entusiasmo patriotico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUrge hacer de la Chongryon una potente organizacion patriotica arraigada profundamente en los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones de base como las filiales y ramas seran como solidas piedras de una muralla que defiende al pais y la nacion. La Chongryon pondra empeno en fortalecer la filial, base regional del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon. Revitalizara las organizaciones ramales que constituyen principales unidades de la vida de los compatriotas, de suerte que dondequiera que viven los compatriotas reine el ambiente de armonia, unidad y amor al pais y la nacion. Las organizaciones y entidades a todos los niveles de la Chongryon ganaran a mas compatriotas de todos los sectores mediante una energica labor politica con las masas, y de esta manera consolidaran y ampliaran en las masas la base del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon. En todas sus actividades la Chongryon se atendra a la linea de masas, concedera preferencia absoluta a las comodidades de vida y la defensa de los intereses de los compatriotas y resolvera todos los problemas apoyandose en su entusiasmo patriotico\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  y fuerza creadora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon miras a aumentar sus propias fuerzas patrioticas, la Chongryon se enfocara en el movimiento de devolverles la nacionalidad a los que la han perdido y vincularlo estrechamente con varias actividades culturales nacionales, deportes masivos, movimientos en defensa de los derechos y actividades de servicio y beneficencia, para que sea un movimiento poderoso protagonizado por los mismos compatriotas y que se impulsa con la fuerza de ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefendera los derechos democraticos nacionales y los intereses de los compatriotas en Japon y seguira dedicando ingentes esfuerzos a la educacion nacional y a la labor con los jovenes, comerciantes e industriales compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mision principal y el deber que asume la Chongryon es proteger los mencionados derechos e intereses. Trabajara con empeno en defender y ampliar todos los derechos de los compatriotas como ciudadanos de un Estado soberano en el extranjero, entre ellos los derechos a la educacion y el negocio y la libertad de viaje a la patria, y luchara de manera resuelta contra todas las medidas discriminatorias y los actos inhumanitarios que violen sus derechos e intereses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMantendra invariablemente la educacion nacional como su tarea fundamental. Implantara el Juche en ella para priorizar el fomento del espiritu patriotico y la identidad nacional; mejorara el contenido y metodo de la ensenanza a la altura de la epoca de la economia del conocimiento, para demostrar asi las ventajas y la vitalidad de la educacion democratica nacional. A la Universidad Coreana, centro docente patrocinado por la Chongryon, le corresponde elevar sin cesar el nivel de la labor docente encaminada a formar a los estudiantes como verdaderos patriotas y competentes profesionales, de modo que sea reconocida como digna y famosa universidad de ciudadanos de la prestigiosa Republica en el extranjero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy las nuevas generaciones de compatriotas en Japon desempenan el papel protagonico en las actividades patrioticas de la Chongryon y de la manera de su preparacion depende el futuro del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon. A la Chongryon, organizacion patriotica que nuestros grandes lideres nos dejaron como herencia, le compete preparar a los jovenes como confiables continuadores de sus actividades que se muestran incolumes ante todas las adversidades. La Union de Jovenes Coreanos en Japon, la Asociacion de Jovenes Comerciantes e Industriales Coreanos y la Union de coreanos radicados en Japon que estudian en otros paises deben lograr que siga prevaleciendo el valioso legado de las generaciones anteriores y educar a los jovenes compatriotas para que vivan con dignidad manteniendo su identidad como coreanos en cualquier momento y lugar. Tambien la Union de Mujeres Democraticas Coreanas en Japon se concentrara en la labor con las compatriotas de la nueva generacion para\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  que ellas mantengan invariable la nacionalidad en la comunidad de compatriotas y preserven intacta la orgullosa tradicion en la cual las mujeres mueven una rueda de la carreta en las actividades patrioticas de la Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario guiar a los comerciantes e industriales, sector principal de la Chongryon y fuerzas fundamentales del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon, a participar de manera activa en la gesta patriotica de la Chongryon. La Federacion de Comerciantes e Industriales Coreanos en Japon y otras agrupaciones economicas deben proteger y ayudar con sinceridad a sus colegas compatriotas, de suerte que estos revitalicen sus actividades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Chongryon y los compatriotas en Japon contribuiran a fortalecer a la patria socialista y a anticipar la reunificacion nacional, cumpliendo asi plenamente la mision y el deber que asumen ante la patria y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el espiritu patriotico coadyuvaran a la noble causa por el fortalecimiento y la prosperidad de la patria socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl destino de los compatriotas en el extranjero esta inseparablemente unido con el de la patria. El prestigio de ellos y de sus organizaciones se elevan en la misma medida en que se hace poderosa la patria. Los funcionarios de la Chongryon y demas compatriotas defenderan por todos los medios la dignidad y el prestigio de la patria socialista y contribuiran a la construccion de una potencia socialista segun la disponibilidad de cada cual: con la fuerza, con el conocimiento o con el dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSosteniendo en alto las Tres Cartas para la reunificacion de la patria, la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, la Chongryon y los compatriotas residentes en Japon desarrollaran con energia el movimiento para reintegrar el pais. Promoveran la unidad nacional con los compatriotas de la Mindan (Asociacion de Ciudadanos Surcoreanos Residentes en Japon) y respaldaran la justa lucha de los habitantes de Corea del Sur a favor de la independencia, democracia y reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el ideal de la independencia, paz y amistad ampliaran las relaciones de buena vecindad con personalidades de todos los sectores y otros habitantes de Japon, crearan con iniciativa coyunturas favorables para las actividades de la Chongryon y el movimiento de los coreanos residentes en Japon y contribuiran al fomento de las relaciones Corea-Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, con miras a abrir exitosamente una nueva era de prosperidad para ese movimiento, es preciso establecer un ordenado sistema de trabajo de la organizacion de acuerdo con el cambio de la situacion y las circunstancias y mejorar el metodo de direccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Presidium Central de la Chongryon debe ser consecuente en la ejecucion de los asuntos discutidos y aprobados segun el principio del centralismo democratico, intensificar la direccion unificada de las organizaciones, organos y entidades economicas a todos los niveles, de modo que todos ellos se mantengan vigorosos y cumplan satisfactoriamente sus deberes. Las organizaciones distritales de la Chongryon estableceran una disciplina y orden que permitan ejecutar cabalmente las resoluciones y directivas de su Presidium Central apoyandose en la inteligencia del colectivo y cumpliran su responsabilidad y papel como unidad de direccion regional del movimiento de los coreanos en Japon. Los organos centrales y las entidades economicas de la Chongryon estableceran un ordenado sistema de trabajo acorde a sus caracteristicas y fomentaran la direccion y ayuda a las instancias inferiores, garantizando asi el exito del trabajo patriotico en sus ramas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario mejorar el metodo de trabajo con arreglo a la situacion concreta de las organizaciones de la Chongryon y la realidad de la comunidad de compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones, organos y entidades economicas a todos los niveles de la Chongryon trabajaran con una vision innovadora, novedoso modo de trabajo y metodologia experimentada y habil y crearan un nuevo espiritu y aspecto del movimiento de los coreanos residentes en Japon que avanza con animo y vigor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbrir o no una nueva era de prosperidad para el movimiento de los coreanos en Japon depende del papel de los funcionarios de la Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando las instrucciones de los grandes lideres como su guia de trabajo y vida, siempre se compenetraran con las masas, compartiran con ellas las alegrias y las penas y seran organizadores y propagandistas que activen su fuerza espiritual. Con el lema de conceder prioridad a los compatriotas en alto, haran gala de su total entrega y sacrificio en defensa de los derechos democraticos de los compatriotas y en bien de su feliz porvenir, de manera que ellos consideren a la Chongryon como el regazo de la madre, confien y se apoyen en ella y la amen de todo corazon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Chongryon forma parte de la patria socialista y los compatriotas coreanos en Japon son nuestros hermanos y miembros de una gran familia por cuyas venas corre la misma sangre que la de los de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro Partido y el Gobierno de la Republica atenderan y se responsabilizaran hasta el fin del destino y futuro de la Chongryon y los compatriotas residentes en Japon que nos encargaron los grandes lideres y se esforzaran por todos los medios para fortalecer el movimiento de los coreanos residentes en Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstoy seguro de que los funcionarios de la Chongryon y todos los demas compatriotas en Japon, seguiran corriendo invariablemente el mismo destino que la patria socialista y cumpliran su honroso deber y responsabilidad en el empeno por abrir una nueva era de prosperidad para el movimiento de los coreanos residentes en Japon."
