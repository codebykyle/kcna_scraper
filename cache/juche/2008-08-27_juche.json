            "content": "Foreign Ministry's Spokesman on DPRK's Decision to Suspend Activities to Disable Nuclear Facilities \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Tuesday in connection with the stumbling block laid by the United States in the way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula by refusing to implement the October 3 agreement of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the October 3 agreement stipulating the practical measures to be taken at the second phase for the implementation of the September 19 joint statement on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the DPRK was committed to presenting a nuclear declaration and the U.S. was also committed to writing the DPRK off the list of the \"state sponsors of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has honored its commitment by presenting the nuclear declaration on June 26. But the U.S. failed to delist the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" within the fixed date for the mere \"reason\" that a protocol on the verification of the nuclear declaration has not yet been agreed upon. This was an outright violation of the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No agreements reached among the six parties or between the DPRK and the U.S. contain an article which stipulates the verification of the nuclear declaration of the DPRK as conditionality for delisting it as a \"state sponsor of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the verification is concerned, it is a commitment to be fulfilled by the six parties at the final phase of the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula according to the September 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should be verified that there are no U.S. nuclear weapons in and around south Korea and that there has been neither new shipment nor passage of those weapons. This verification and the verification of the DPRK's fulfillment of its commitments should be done at the same time. This is the principle of \"action for action\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All that was agreed upon at the present phase was to set up verification and monitoring mechanisms within the framework of the six parties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an \"international standard\" to the verification of the nuclear declaration, abusing this agreed point. It pressurized the DPRK to accept such inspection as scouring any place of the DPRK as it pleases to collect samples and measure them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"international standard\" touted by the U.S. is nothing but \"special inspection\" which the IAEA called for in the 1990s to infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and caused it to pull out of the NPT in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the DPRK as it pleases just as it did in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. insistence on the unilateral inspection of the DPRK is a brigandish demand for unilaterally disarming the DPRK, the other belligerent party, by discarding its commitment to the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula the core of which is to remove the U.S. nuclear threat according to the September 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's intention to denuclearize the peninsula is to remove the nuclear threat from the Korean nation, not to have a bargaining over the DPRK's nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFor whom is the six-way structure necessary if the six-party talks are reduced to a platform for a big country to trifle with a small country as it does at present? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the U.S. postponed the process of delisting the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" under the pretext of verification even after officially declaring internally and externally that the DPRK is not a \"state sponsor of terrorism\". This is little short of admitting that the list is not related to terrorism in actuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care whether it continues remaining on the list of \"those countries which are disobedient to the U.S.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now keen to gravely encroach upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. breached the agreed points, the DPRK is compelled to take the following countermeasures on the principle of \"action for action\":&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First, the DPRK decided to immediately suspend the disablement of its nuclear facilities that had been underway according to the October 3 agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This step took effect on August 14 and the parties concerned have already been notified of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second, the DPRK will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon to their original state as strongly requested by its relevant institutions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

All this is the fruition of the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter stressed that thanks to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il a Juche-oriented great prosperous powerful nation will appear on this land and only victory and glory are always in store for the trade union, a powerful transmission belt of the Party.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is working with bloodshot eyes to scrap the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration the core of which is the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that failure to handle the reunification issue by placing the national dignity and interests above anything else and considering them as criteria would only escalate the confrontation and perpetuate the division and spark off a war in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who resolutely stand up against outside forces' aggression and interference and struggle to positively defend the national dignity and interests are patriots in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans will never pardon the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors hell-bent on the inter-Korean confrontation and moves to provoke a war against the north, while cooperating with outside forces in utter disregard of the national dignity and interests and checking the advance of the cause of national reunification in collusion with them, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pero  tal inspeccion causo el resultado de que esta se retiro del Tratado de No Proliferacion Nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSi EE.UU. pensaba que puede inspeccionar arbitrariamente la RPDC como Iraq, se equivoca mucho. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLa inspeccion unilateral de EE.UU. sobre nuestro pais es una demanda bandidesca para desarmar a la RPDC, una de las partes beligerantes que estan  apuntando los fusiles una contra otra al dejar a un lado la desnuclearizacion de toda la Peninsula Coreana cuyo nucleo es la eliminacion de la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. que conviene a la Declaracion  Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNuestra proposicion de desnuclearizar la Peninsula Coreana es para eliminar la amenaza nuclear contra la nacion coreana y no es para regatear nuestra fuerza disuasiva nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSi las conversaciones de 6 bandas se convierten en un lugar donde un pais grande puede burlar a su antojo a un pequeno pais como ahora, ?a quien necesita  tal dialogo? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEsta vez, EE.UU. declaro oficialmente al interior y  el exterior que la RPDC no es el \"pais que apoya al terrorismo\", pero, dilato su eliminacion en la  lista en cuestion bajo el pretexto del problema de  verificacion. Esto prueba que EE.UU. reconoce que tal lista no sirve del documento relativo al terrorismo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNo importa que la RPDC este en la lista de los \"paises que no obedecen docilmente a EE.UU.\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAhora, este pais norteamericano intenta violar gravemente la soberania de aquella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDado que EE.UU. incumple los articulos del citado acuerdo, la RPDC, segun el principio de \"accion vs. accion\", no puede menos que tomar las siguientes contramedidas: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPrimero, decidio poner de inmediato fin a la obra de neutralizacion de las instalaciones nucleares en marcha segun el Acuerdo del 3 de Octubre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTal medida se ha puesto en vigencia a partir del pasado dia 14 y la RPDC lo aviso ya a las partes correspondientes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSegundo, a la fuerte peticion de los organos correspondientes, tendra en consideracion la medida de reconstruir pronto las instalaciones nucleares de Nyongbyon como estado original.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Inevitable responsabilidad de Japon por incidente de \"Ukishima maru\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 23 de agosto (ATCC) -- En el pasado Japon cometio incontables crimenes de masacre contra el pueblo coreano, entre otros, el incidente horrible de explosion y hundimiento del barco \"Ukishima maru\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El 24 de agosto de 1945, los imperialistas japoneses hicieron hundir intencionalmente en el mar frente al puerto Maizuru de la prefectura de Kyoto el  buque de transporte de las fuerzas navales de antiguo Japon \"Ukishima maru\", para sepultar en el agua a miles de coreanos inocentes que regresaban a la patria con la alegria de la liberacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los coreanos que iban a bordo de este barco eran victimas de la tirania colonial del imperialismo japones. Despues de ser privados de la patria por estos imperialistas, fueron arrastrados a los campos de guerra de agresion y a los lugares de trabajos duros y sobrevivieron a duras penas al cabo de ser sometidos al desprecio nacional y el trabajo de esclavo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los barbaros nipones los sepultaron en el mar a partir de la represalia de su derrota sin lograr la ambicion de la \"esfera de coprosperidad de la gran Asia Oriental\" y de la maligna intencion de ocultar para siempre todos sus crimenes cometidos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, en aquel entonces los verdaderos aspectos del caso fueron encubiertos por el gobierno japones, que lo describio como un \"accidente inevitable\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con el fin de dejar eternamente en secreto los verdaderos aspectos del caso, el gobierno japones no confirmo las direcciones y nombres de las victimas ni aclaro el numero correcto de los muertos por el hundimiento del barco. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De esta manera, Japon trato de tergiversar y reducir de todas maneras el verdadero aspecto de la perdida de coreanos y de evadir su obligacion de pedir disculpa y hacer indemnizacion a los familiares de las victimas y su responsabilidad por el caso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hasta la fecha el gobierno japones no soluciona el incidente y evade su responsabilidad por el respecto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n? El incidente del barco \"Ukishima maru\" es justamente un crimen ejecutado intencionalmente por el gobierno japones segun su plan de genocidio a los coreanos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pues, Japon debe reconocer su responsabilidad por este crimen, pedir disculpa y hacer indemnizacion a los familiares de las victimas.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
