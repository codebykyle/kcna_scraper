But it only betrays before the world the shameless ugly colors of the confrontational maniacs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations can never be mended and only war will be brought as long as the puppet forces persist in the sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation of social systems."

Korean Forces Colonial Stooges\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The British Association for the Study of Songun Policy posted an article on its website on March 26.\n\t\t\t\t\t After the shocking case in which a south Korean citizen attacked the U.S. ambassador to south Korea with a knife in Seoul on March 5, the south Korean chief executive consoled him and paid a well-wishing visit, the article said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an expression of \"sincere service\" of a colonial servant. This reminds one of a stooge working hard to curry favor with colonial governor-general.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What draws serious attention is that the case caused the whirlwind of frantic racket of eliminating the \"forces following the north\" across south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, different circles of south Korea are ridiculing and denouncing the puppet group, hardly repressing towering resentment at its sycophancy, submission and hysteria for eliminating the \"forces following the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accusing the \"president\", they praised Kim Ki Jong who mounted a knife attack on the U.S. ambassador as a patriot. They are urging the conservative authorities to stop the war \"alliance\" with the U.S. and withdraw the U.S. troops from south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent case brought home to the world people the true colors of the puppet group as colonial stooges through its racket for eliminating the \"forces following the north\" and anti-DPRK confrontation hysteria that have reached the height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The British Group for the Study of the Juche Idea and the Korean Friendship Association UK also posted similar articles on their websites."
