            "content": "Kim Jong Un Sends Letter to Those Attending Seventh Congress of GFTUK\r\nPyongyang, October 27 (KCNA) -- Supreme leader Kim Jong Un on Oct. 25 sent a letter \"The Duty of the Working Class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for the Times and the Tasks Facing Trade Union Organizations\" to those attending the Seventh Congress of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea (GFTUK).\n\t\t\t\t\t The following is the full text of the letter:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the period of revolutionary upsurge, when the whole Party, the entire army and all the people are stepping up the general offensive to hasten final victory in building a powerful socialist country holding high the gigantic programme advanced by the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Seventh Congress of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea is being held.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This congress will constitute a historic occasion for demonstrating to the whole world the strength of our working class rallied firmly behind the Party and their confidence in sure victory and, by further improving the functions and fighting efficiency of trade union organizations, enlisting the working class and all other trade union members in the Mallima advance of the new era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I extend warm congratulations to the congress and wish it a great success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The GFTUK is a mass political organization of the working class faithful to the Party, an organization founded and steadily developed thanks to the energetic leadership and deep trust of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il; it is also a powerful combat force in implementing the revolutionary cause of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With an understanding of the importance of the position and role of the working class in the revolution and construction, Comrade Kim Il Sung, after founding the Party following the country's liberation, formed the General Federation of Labour Unions of North Korea as a unitary political organization embracing the broad sections of the working class. In every period and at every stage of the developing revolution he indicated the road ahead of the organization and wisely led it so that the working class could perform their responsibility and basic duty as a vanguard detachment in the revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the basis of the Juche-oriented idea on building working people's organizations, Comrade Kim Jong Il provided definite guidelines for developing the GFTUK into a reliable assistant and champion of the Party, and led it so that its organizations could fulfill its mission and tasks as a body for political and ideological education. He also lit torches for mass movements, ensuring that the flames of collective, collaborative innovations flared up in socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great leaders called the working class first whenever difficult and gigantic tasks arose for the revolution, and ushered in fresh heydays of the revolution by relying on them. Their warm affection and trust and wise leadership trained the working class and other trade union members into heroes of the times and enabled the GFTUK to follow only the road of loyalty without changing its course even in the face of the whirlwind of history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cherishing absolute trust in and revolutionary obligation towards the great leaders, the working class and the GFTUK supported the Party and the leaders with loyalty, braving the serious ordeals and hardships in the vanguard. Holding high the banner of self-reliance our working class built on the debris on this land a socialist industrial state in a short period after the war in the spirit of Chollima. In the trying days of the Arduous March and anti-US confrontation, they fought with a do-or-die determination and will, thus making a great contribution to the development of the self-reliant defence industry and to the cause of building a powerful socialist country. The world-startling, miraculous events including those of turning misfortunes into blessing taking place now in various parts of the country are associated with the sweat and blood of patriotic loyalty shed by the working class and other trade union members who are supporting the Party's leadership with one mind a\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t nd will, shoulder to shoulder with the service personnel. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I extend warm thanks and militant greetings to the working class, other trade union members and officials of the GFTUK across the country, who, believing only in our Party with a single mind both in good times and bad, have devoted their patriotic enthusiasm and wisdom for the prosperity of the socialist country to the call of the Party and the leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today our people have forcefully turned out in the grandiose struggle to build a powerful socialist country under the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism advanced by the historic Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In today's all-people general onward march, the working class, strong in the spirit of the revolution and organization and possessed of inexhaustible creative strength, ought to take charge of and play a leading, pioneer role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party conferred the honourable title, \"the heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il,\" on our working class that supported the great leaders' ideas and leadership with loyalty. This title bears the unshakeable will and determination of our Party to carry forward in their entirety the idea of prioritizing the working class and leadership of the great leaders, who, by placing them in the vanguard, effected gigantic social and historical changes and tided over the trying hardships; it also reflects the Party's great trust and expectation that they will fulfil their basic duty as the working class of Kim Il Sung and    Kim Jong Il in implementing the revolutionary cause of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, holding aloft the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, should become the engine propelling the masses forward on the general onward march and the example for all other members of society to follow in stepping up the building of a powerful socialist country. This is the noble duty they have assumed for the country and the revolution in the new era of the Juche revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bearing in mind the great trust of the Party and the people, our working class should creditably perform this honourable mission and duty as befits the advance force for the Juche revolution and the eldest sons of the nation who have been trained under the close concern of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For them to fulfil their sacred duty for the times, it is important to bring about a decisive improvement in the work of the GFTUK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The GFTUK is a powerful political instrument for training its members, including the working class, into Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists with unfailing loyalty to the Party and the leader and mobilizing them to implement the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should take modelling itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as its general task.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our revolution advances and wins victories on the strength of the unity of the Party, the army and the broad sections of the working masses. Modelling the whole Party, the entire army and working people's organizations including the youth league and the GFTUK on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is just the way to carry out the cause of imbuing the whole society with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. And this is the key to the final victory of the socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Modelling the GFTUK on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the fundamental guarantee for making the working class revolutionary, developing them into an elite force and enhancing their core, leading role in every way possible. When the working class, who constitute the progressive force and hardcore of our society, become the engine and play an exemplary role in leading its other members forward, the great cause will be successfully carried on of transforming all members of society and all realms of social life in keeping with the requirements of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Party's unified leadership system should be established more firmly across the GFTUK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Modelling the GFTUK on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is an undertaking of developing it into a body that is ideologically pure and organizationally integrated, an organization over which Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism holds undivided sway and which moves as one under the Party's unified leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The permanent guiding ideology of the GFTUK is the great Kimilsungism- Kimjongilism. The GFTUK should conduct its building and activities with this ideology as its sole guideline. It should staunchly defend the great leaders' idea and theory on building trade union and their undying leadership exploits, and apply them to the letter. It should also carry out the instructions they gave in their lifetime, holding fast to them as its lifeblood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should remain infinitely loyal to the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. Its organizations should adhere to our Party's ideas, lines and policies in planning and executing their work. They should establish rigid discipline and order whereby all the problems that arise in their work are brought to the Party in time and dealt with according to its decisions. They should defy death in implementing the Party's lines and policies. They should promptly transmit its policies and directives to the lowest echelons and carry them out in the shortest possible period and at the highest possible level. Just as the eldest child empathizes with and supports his or her parents before his or her siblings, so the working class, who are the eldest sons of the nation, should take the lead in translating the Party's intentions and demands into reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defending the Party Central Committee unto death is the life and soul and a proud tradition of the Korean working class. One generation of the working class may be replaced by another, but their tradition of faithfully supporting the Party and the leader and the history of single-hearted unity should be carried forward forever. The working class and other trade union members should absolutely trust and follow only the Party at all times and throw in their lot with it to the last like the workers of Kunja-ri and Ragwon who worked indomitably in the flames of war for its victory by cherishing the firm conviction that they would surely win as they were led by Comrade Kim Il Sung and like those of Kangson who guarded the Party and the leader at the risk of their lives by effecting the great Chollima upsurge. They should defend the ideology and authority of the Party in the spirit they displayed in postwar days, when they safeguarded the Party shouting they would throw the factio\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t nal elements into the electric furnace; they should not in the least overlook or compromise with anti-Party and unsound practices of all hues revealed in implementing the Party's policies, but resolutely smash them with their iron fists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to strengthen guidance of the organizational and ideological life in the trade union so as to fully prepare all its members as true Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The organizational and ideological life in the trade union is a school for ideological education to train its members to be Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists and a crucible for organizational training. Trade union organizations should take the guidance of organizational and ideological life as the main line and give top priority to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All efforts should be concentrated on the ideological education of trade union members.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trade union organizations should vigorously conduct the five-point education advanced by the Party in order to make all their members persons strong in ideas and faith, ardent patriots, vanguard fighters of the class and noble morality incarnate, who are fully equipped with the ideological and spiritual qualities becoming Kimilsungists- Kimjongilists. They should put efforts into educating their members to learn from the revolutionary soldier spirit and the spirit of the Paektusan hero youth. They should implant in them the Party's idea and line of prioritizing military affairs so as to make them study military affairs with sincerity and remain alert and prepared at all times by firmly holding the weapon of the revolution in one hand and the hammer of the class in the other. They should intensify ideological education and ideological struggle, which are aimed at smashing the reactionary ideological and cultural infiltration by the imperialists and their following forces, so \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t as to keep their members from being contaminated by the capitalist poison and lead all of them to hold fast to the working-class stand and live and work in a sound and revolutionary manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ideological education of them should be conducted in various forms, by various methods and in a novel manner in keeping with their preparedness and characteristics. The precisely-targeted method of ideological work of the Party should be applied positively to step up the ideological remoulding of the working class and other trade union members and make the whole country bubble with enthusiasm for effecting a great upswing. It is important to properly furnish the educational bases of the trade union and conduct education by means of them in a planned and regular way. The education system set up in trade union organizations should be utilized in an effective way, and all the means and ways of information and motivation work enlisted in carrying out the tasks prioritized by the Party, important policy-oriented tasks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Guidance to the organizational life of the trade union members should be intensified.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrade union organizations should make scrupulous arrangements for guiding them in their organizational life with the focus put on improving their loyalty to the Party and the leader and in combination with the implementation of their revolutionary assignments. They should encourage them to get into the habit of voluntarily participating in the organizational life, so that they always rely on their organizations in and out of work and carry out the decisions and assignments of their organizations in time and without fail. They should improve the level of organizational life review sessions to make them an important occasion in educating and training their members in a revolutionary way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should establish rigid organizational discipline and make a strict demand for organizational life. They should arrange the organizational life in compliance with the union Rules and the regulations of union life and strengthen organizational control of their members to prevent them from living divorced from their organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working class and other trade union members should be enlisted in the building of a powerful socialist country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trade union organizations should conduct dynamic political work, information and motivation work, aimed at giving free rein to the spiritual strength of the working class and other trade union members who are out in socialist construction, and thus encourage them to perform fresh miraculous feats. This will make it possible to help the working class and other trade union members conduct a vigorous production campaign to implement the five-year strategy for national economic development, fulfil their daily, monthly and quarterly assignments without fail and become honourable Mallima riders who perform miraculous innovations in science, education, public health, literature, the arts and all other fields. They should also work devotedly in their workplaces regarding them as outposts in the grand campaign to build a powerful socialist country, and thus create more assets conducive to strengthening the country's defence capability, developing the economy and promoting the people'\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t s well-being. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important in building a powerful socialist country to comprehensively apply the spirit of self-development first. Cherishing the firm conviction that things of our own are the best and our own strength is the greatest, the working class and other trade union members should give full play to their fighting spirit of self-reliance so as to boldly effect domestic production of necessary materials and equipment and upgrading of technical processes of production and create the highest standard of socialist civilization. With the self-respect and courage as befits the working class of Korea, they should produce everything better than others', and thus sweep away the proclivity to imports and demonstrate the resourcefulness of the nation and the honour of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are to be strong in the self-development capability and play the major role in the era of the knowledge-based economy, the working class and other trade union members should master modern science and technology. Nothing is impossible when the revolutionary spirit of the working class is combined with modern science and technology. The working class and other trade union members, bearing in mind the Party's intention to prepare all the people as intelligent workers, scientific and technical personnel, should be enrolled in the study-while-you-work system like distance education and study hard to raise the level of their knowledge of modern science and technology and cultural attainments. They should reject the tendencies to relying only on experience and thinking technology as something mysterious, and present new inventions and valuable technical innovations, thus making a positive contribution to the scientific and technological development of their respective units\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  and to the building of a knowledge-based economy. Trade union organizations should support and lead the working class and other trade union members so that they can stand in the vanguard of the campaign to make all the people well-versed in science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trade union organizations should ensure that the working class and other trade union members conduct mass-based sporting, cultural and artistic activities on a regular basis and establish a cultured way of production and life, so as to create a new culture of the working class and make the whole society brim over with vibrant spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mass movement is a powerful means for bringing about an uninterrupted upsurge in socialist construction on the strength of collective innovations. Trade union organizations should organize and briskly conduct socialist emulation campaign, mass technical innovation drive, movement to create model lathes following the example of Lathe No. 26, good-conduct movement and other mass movements as demanded by the reality, when a powerful socialist country is being built on a new high. By doing so, they can encourage the working class and other trade union members to devote all their enthusiasm and wisdom to socialist construction. They should set ambitious targets for the movements, with the main stress put on implementing the strategic tasks advanced by the Seventh Congress of the Party and in reflection of the aspirations and demands of the masses, and strive persistently to hit them; then the vitality of these movements can be given fullest play. They should give the working clas\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t s and other trade union members a correct understanding of the objectives of the movements and ways of achieving them, generalize positive examples and properly review and evaluate the results, so as to inspire them with interest in and enthusiasm for the movements and enliven the social atmosphere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an important task facing the working class and the GFTUK to strive for the realization of the independent reunification of the country and global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working class and other trade union members should fully equip themselves with our Party's line and policy of the independent national reunification, and stand in the vanguard of the struggle to carry them out. They should actively support and encourage the workers in south Korea in their struggle for anti-US independence, democratization of society and their right to existence, promote solidarity and collaboration with labour union organizations in south Korea under the ideal of By Our Nation Itself, and thus open up the road to independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The GFTUK should defend and apply our Party's idea and principles of foreign policy, encourage the progressive peoples of the world in their struggle for independence, peace and socialism, and develop relations of good-neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation with the trade unions in other countries and international labour organizations, so as to expand the ranks of the supporters of and sympathizers with our revolution and accelerate the cause of global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the successful implementation of the tasks facing the GFTUK, its organizations at all levels should be strengthened and their functions and role enhanced. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Guidance organs of the GFTUK should be built up, and their members should fully discharge their responsibilities. These organs at all levels should be formed with many hard-core trade union members working on the shop floor, as well as officials of the GFTUK and in the administrative and economic sectors. The organs should take proactive steps to carry out the tasks facing trade union organizations and give assignments to their members on a regular basis, thus making them active in their work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The main link in the whole chain of improving the trade union work is to enhance the role of its primary organizations including those at the lowest echelons, the basic combat units in implementing the Party's policies for the GFTUK. They should give priority to the work with their members so as to rally all of them firmly behind the Party and inspire them forcefully to the implementation of its policies. By working effectively with their hard-core, active members, they should remould the masses in such a way that one educates ten and ten, one hundred, and thus strengthen themselves. As for the members who have some shortcomings in their work and life, they should make earnest efforts to educate them and help them with sincerity, so that all their members can keep pace with the dynamic advance of the times, their hearts pulsating to the same beat as it. It is necessary to step up the movement for creating the Model Organization of Loyalty and organize on an extensive scale t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t he campaigns in which one overtakes and learns from others and swaps experiences with them, so that all the primary organizations work with unabated vigour and the whole of the GFTUK brims over with enthusiasm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Provincial, city and county committees of the GFTUK should enhance their role. Provincial committees of the GFTUK, as its regional guidance units, should establish a well-regulated organizational life guidance system and strengthen control and guidance over their subordinate organizations, so as to make them working political entities. City and county trade union organizations should put the main emphasis on their internal work and work with the lower-echelon organizations, with the aim of steadily enhancing their fighting efficiency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the GFTUK is the General Staff that is responsible for planning the trade union work as a whole and providing unified guidance over it under the leadership of the Party. It should take the great leaders' instructions and the Party's policies as its sole guideline and orient all aspects of its work to implementing them. It should ensure that its departments and sections cooperate with one another under a scrupulous plan, and exercise effective control and guidance over its subordinates. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fighting efficiency and role of trade union organizations are dependent largely on the qualifications and work methods of their officials who are in charge of organizing and guiding the trade union work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trade union officials should make efforts to improve their political and practical qualifications. They should firmly equip themselves with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and be fully conversant with the great leaders' instructions and the Party's policies for their respective sectors, making them an element of their firm faith. They should become competent political workers who are proficient in the trade union work and capable of organizing and conducting it creatively on their own initiative. They should acquire many-sided knowledge including modern science and technology and enhance their cultural attainments, mixing unceremoniously with the masses and effectively enlisting them in creating a Mallima speed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trade union officials should fully equip themselves with Comrade Kim Jong Il's work methods and apply them to practice. They should follow the ennobling examples he set in educating and guiding the masses, and do everything as instructed by him. They should go down to the lower echelons as a matter of routine, mingling with the masses in and out of their work and helping and leading them forward. They should eliminate such outdated and backward methods of working as merely conveying the Party's policies to the lower-echelon organizations or confining the trade union work to meetings and paperwork. Instead, they should always go deep among the masses, sowing seeds and harvesting fruits by themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Party organizations should prioritize the trade union work and throw their full weight behind it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should build up the ranks of trade union officials with competent people who are faithful to the Party, popular among the masses, tempered through labour and possessed of practical abilities. They should pay close concern to educating these officials to ensure that they are fully aware of their basic duty and make strenuous efforts to fulfil their responsibility and role. They should identify, among trade union members on the shop floor, those who are loyal to the Party and promising, as reserve cadres of the GFTUK, temper them through practice and send them to training institutions so as to bring them up in a systematic way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trade union organizations should be encouraged to enhance their sense of independence and creativity. Party committees at all levels should promptly inform them of the Party's policies in each period so that they can conduct their work and activities in conformity with the ideas and intentions of the Party. Party organizations should lead them to draw up their work plans in a proactive way and carry them out with courage. They should do away with the practice of shouldering the work of trade union organizations in their place; they should be bold in assigning tasks to trade union officials and inspire them to carry them out by their own efforts. They should provide trade union organizations with working conditions and give prominence and praise to their officials for the work done, so that they can work to the best of their abilities feeling dignity and honour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the working class redouble their efforts and trade union organizations are full of vigour, the might of our revolutionary ranks will be further strengthened and bigger strides will be made in the building of a powerful socialist country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I firmly believe that the working class and all other members of the GFTUK and its organizations will fully demonstrate the heroic mettle as befits the working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and will make an active contribution to hastening final victory in building a powerful socialist country by fulfilling with credit the noble mission and duty they have assumed for the country and the revolution, true to the lofty intentions of the great leaders."

Asimismo, en cada periodo y etapa de desarrollo de la revolucion ilumino el camino a seguir por la Federacion y oriento acertadamente a la clase obrera para que cumpliera con su responsabilidad y mision como vanguardia de la revolucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPartiendo de la idea original sobre la construccion de organizaciones de trabajadores, el gran General Kim Jong Il presento una directriz que asegurara la conversion de la federacion de sindicatos en fidedigna ayudante y defensora del Partido,  condujo a las organizaciones sindicales para que cumplieran impecablemente su mision y tarea como educadoras politicas e ideologicas y, al tomar la iniciativa del movimiento masivo, promovio la innovacion colectiva y solidaria en la construccion socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ardiente amor, la plena confianza y la atinada direccion de los grandes Lideres, quienes cada vez que enfrentaban una dificil y colosal tarea revolucionaria acudian ante todo a los obreros para abrir un nuevo esplendor de la revolucion, fueron muestras de gran benevolencia de quienes formaron a ellos y demas miembros de la Federacion como heroes de la epoca, logrando que esa organizacion siguiera inalterable por el camino de lealtad en las voragines de la historia.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la plena confianza y el sentido del deber revolucionario, tanto los obreros como la Federacion han sido fieles al Partido y al lider, superando antes que nadie las duras pruebas y dificultades. Con la confianza en sus propias fuerzas y el impetu de Chollima (caballo legendario que corre al dia 400 kilometros - N.T.), pocos anos despues de terminada la guerra nuestros obreros levantaron un Estado industrial socialista para la envidia del mundo en estas tierras donde todo se habia reducido a cenizas y, al trabajar con inquebrantable determinacion y voluntad en los cruentos dias de la Marcha Penosa y del enfrentamiento con el imperialismo norteamericano, hicieron aportes sustanciales al desarrollo de la industria de la autodefensa nacional y la obra de la edificacion de la potencia socialista.  Los portentosos acontecimientos que asombran al mundo y los milagros que truecan la desgracia en suerte se deben  al fervoroso sentimiento de patriotismo y lealtad de los obreros y otros miembros de la Federacion quienes, hombro con hombro con los soldados del Ejercito Popular, siguen invariablemente fieles a la direccion del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExtiendo mi mas sincero agradecimiento y efusivos saludos militantes a los obreros y otros miembros y funcionarios de la Federacion de todo el pais quienes han hecho gala de su ardor patriotico e inteligencia en aras del fortalecimiento y la prosperidad de la patria socialista, confiando solamente en nuestro Partido tanto en los dias ordinarios como en los duros y en respuesta al llamamiento del Partido y el lider.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy nuestro pueblo se ha levantado con mucho brio en la grandiosa obra de la construccion de la potencia socialista, enarbolando la consigna de identificar a toda la sociedad con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo, lanzada por el historico VII Congreso del PTC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actual marcha de todo el pueblo, la clase obrera revolucionaria, organizada y dotada de inagotable creatividad debe desempenar necesariamente el papel de protagonista y orientadora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFieles a la idea y direccion de los grandes Lideres, los obreros coreanos han sido dignificados por nuestro Partido como heroica clase obrera de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il. Esta denominacion refleja la ferrea voluntad de nuestro Partido de continuar al pie de la letra la idea y la direccion de los grandes Lideres quienes produjeron las inmensas transformaciones socio-historicas y vencieron las duras pruebas poniendo en primer plano a los obreros, asi como sintetiza la gran muestra de confianza y esperanza de que cumplan sus deberes como obreros del Lider y del General en la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa heroica clase obrera de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il impulsara vigorosamente la construccion de la potencia socialista, como locomotora de la marcha general y paradigma de la sociedad que enarbola la identificacion de toda la sociedad segun el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo. Tal es la noble tarea que le asignan ante la patria y la revolucion en la nueva era de la revolucion del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsciente de la gran confianza depositada en ella por el Partido y el pueblo, nuestra clase obrera cumplira intachablemente la honrosa mision y deber que asume ante la patria y la revolucion como avanzada de la revolucion del Juche y primogenita del pais que ha crecido y se ha fortalecido al amparo de los grandes Lideres. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara lograr que ella cumpla su sagrada tarea para la epoca, es necesario renovar decisivamente las labores de la Federacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta es una poderosa arma politica que forma a los obreros y a sus miembros como kimilsungista-kimjongilistas ilimitadamente fieles al Partido y el lider y que los moviliza para la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebe asumir como tarea principal de la lucha la identificacion de todos sus miembros con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra revolucion avanza y triunfa con la fuerza unida del Partido, el Ejercito y las amplias masas laboriosas. La causa de la identificacion de toda la sociedad con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo se logra exitosamente solamente cuando se asimilan con esa ideologia todo el Partido, Ejercito y las agrupaciones de trabajadores como la Union de la Juventud y la Federacion General de los Sindicatos. He aqui el triunfo definitivo de la causa socialista, la causa revolucionaria del Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIdentificar a la Federacion con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo constituye la garantia fundamental para preparar a los obreros como revolucionarios y elite y elevar por todos los medios su papel de nucleos y orientadores. Cuando la clase obrera, precursora y fuerza principal de nuestra sociedad, la conduce como locomotora y ejemplo, podemos propulsar exitosamente la ingente obra de transformar a todos los integrantes de la sociedad y aspectos de la vida social segun los requisitos del kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso establecer mas firmemente el sistema de direccion unica del Partido en el seno de la Federacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsimilar a toda esta con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo es una labor encaminada a hacer de ella un cuerpo puro sustentado solamente en dicha ideologia, un ente organicamente integro y de accion coordinada donde todos se mueven como un solo hombre bajo la unica direccion del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo es y sera eternamente la idea rectora de la Federacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA esta le corresponde tomar el kimilsungismo - kimjongilismo como su unica directriz en su construccion y actividades. Es indispensable defender resueltamente y aplicar estrictamente las ideas y teorias de los grandes Lideres sobre la construccion de la Federacion y sus imperecederas proezas de direccion, asi como asumir como sustento y materializar cabalmente sus legados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Federacion sera fiel sin limites a la direccion del PTC. A sus organizaciones les compete disenar y ejecutar sus labores en atencion a la idea, el lineamiento y la politica de nuestro Partido. Deben implantar una ferrea disciplina y orden que les permiten informar a su debido tiempo al Partido de todos los problemas que enfrentan y manejarlos de acuerdo con las conclusiones del Partido. Les atane materializar a toda costa las lineas y la politica del Partido. Deben transmitir sin demora sus orientaciones e instrucciones a todas las instancias, incluidas las mas inferiores, y ejecutarlas lo antes posible en un nivel supremo. Tal y como el mayor de los hermanos lee antes que otros el pensamiento de los padres, la clase obrera, primogenita del pais, sera la primera en acatar el proposito y el requerimiento del Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefender resueltamente el Comite Central del Partido es la primera razon de ser y una orgullosa tradicion de los obreros coreanos. Aunque nuevas generaciones de obreros suceden a las viejas, la historia de la lealtad al Partido y al lider y de la unidad monolitica debe proseguir por los siglos de los siglos. La clase obrera y los miembros de la Federacion deben siempre confiar y seguir unica e incondicionalmente al Partido y correr la misma suerte que el, como los obreros de la comuna Kunja y de Rakwon que en el fragor de la guerra lucharon sin doblegar, convencidos de que con el Lider saldrian victoriosos infaliblemente, y como los obreros de Kangson quienes sostuvieron al Partido y lider con el gran auge de Chollima. Preservaran por todos los medios la idea y el prestigio del Partido con el espiritu de los de la posguerra que en defensa del Partido declararon a los sectarios que los echarian al horno electrico. No toleraran ni se conciliaran en lo minimo con los fenomenos negativos u opuestos al Partido a la hora de materializar las orientaciones del Partido, y con su puno de hierro asestaran golpes demoledores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl intensificar la direccion sobre la vida organica e ideologica de sus integrantes, deben preparar a todos ellos como autenticos kimilsungista-kimjongilistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mencionada vida es un centro de educacion ideologica que forma a los kimilsungista-kimjongilistas y un horno que los curte mediante la organizacion. Las organizaciones sindicales deben tomar esa direccion como tarea principal y prestarle atencion primordial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben concentrarse en la educacion ideologica a sus miembros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes compete intensificar la educacion en los cinco puntos presentada por el Partido, de manera que todos sus integrantes se formen como hombres de firme idea y conviccion, fervorosos patriotas, vanguardias en la lucha de clases, seres dotados de nobles rasgos morales que encarnan las cualidades ideologico-espirituales propias del kimilsungista - kimjongilista. Les atane poner gran empeno en la educacion para aprender el espiritu revolucionario de los militares y el de los heroes jovenes del monte Paektu. Inculcaran a sus miembros la idea y el lineamiento del Partido acerca de la priorizacion militar para que aprendan a conciencia los asuntos militares y mantengan siempre el estado de tension y alerta, empunando en una mano el fusil de la revolucion y en otra el martillo de la clase. Intensificaran la educacion y la lucha ideologicas encaminadas a frustrar las maniobras de penetracion ideologica y cultural del imperialismo y sus seguidores, de manera que todos sus miembros mantengan firme la posicion de la clase obrera y lleven una vida revolucionaria, sin contagiarse del veneno capitalista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la educacion ideologica de sus miembros deben aplicar varias formas y metodos y la originalidad conforme al nivel de preparacion y las caracteristicas de cada uno de ellos. Impulsaran la reformacion ideologica de los obreros y otros integrantes aplicando el metodo de precision a la labor ideologica del Partido, asi como fomentaran el gran auge en todo el pais. Hay que acondicionar bien los centros de educacion de los integrantes de la Federacion y planificar y normalizar la educacion ideologica a traves de ellos. Urge establecer un eficiente sistema educativo en las organizaciones de la Federacion y recurrir a todos los medios y metodos de propaganda para resolver las cuestiones priorizadas por el Partido y las importantes tareas politicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que intensificar la direccion sobre la vida organica de los miembros de la Federacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones sindicales se esmeraran en esa direccion tomando como lo fundamental elevar la fidelidad al Partido y el lider y vinculandola estrechamente con el cumplimiento de las tareas revolucionarias. Implantaran entre sus miembros un regimen de participar voluntariamente en la vida organica para que se apoyen siempre en la organizacion y cumplan a tiempo e infaliblemente sus resoluciones y tareas. Elevaran el nivel de balance de la vida organica de los miembros, de modo que este sea una buena oportunidad para educarlos y forjarlos con los principios revolucionarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las organizaciones de la Federacion les compete implantar una recia disciplina y ser mas exigentes respecto a la vida organica. La orientaran a tenor de los postulados de los estatutos de la Federacion y del reglamento de la vida en ella y fortaleceran el control de sus miembros para que nadie se aparte de ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMovilizaran energicamente a los obreros y miembros de los sindicatos a la construccion de la potencia socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMediante energicas actividades politicas y propagandisticas dirigidas a incentivar el espiritu de esos constructores del socialismo, los convocaran a las nuevas hazanas y prodigios. Los orientaran a que vigoricen la campana de produccion llamada a llevar a buen termino la estrategia quinquenal para el desarrollo de la economia nacional y que cumplan infaliblemente  el plan de cada dia, mes y trimestre, para asi ser protagonistas de milagros e innovaciones y dignos abanderados del movimiento Mallima en todas las esferas como la ciencia, la educacion, la salud publica, el arte y la literatura. Los encauzaran a que trabajen con abnegacion considerando sus puestos de trabajo como avanzadas de la empresa de la construccion de una potencia socialista, para producir mas bienes que contribuyan a la defensa nacional, el desarrollo economico y el fomento del bienestar del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs importante manifestar plenamente el espiritu de fortalecerse con los medios propios en la construccion de la potencia socialista. Convencidos de que son mejores lo nuestro y nuestra fuerza y poniendo de manifiesto el espiritu de apoyarnos en nuestras propias fuerzas, los obreros y los miembros de la Federacion obtendran materias primas y fabricaran equipos en el pais, modernizaran con audacia los procesos productivos y tecnicos y alcanzaran el mas alto nivel de la civilizacion socialista. Con la autoestima y el coraje de la clase obrera coreana, todo lo fabricaran con sus propias manos y mejor que nadie, se liberaran completamente de la propension a la importacion y demostraran plenamente la sabiduria nacional y el honor de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara ser los que se fortalecen mas con sus propios recursos y protagonistas de la era de la economia del conocimiento, dominaran las modernas ciencias y tecnologia. Si las combinan con su espiritu revolucionario, nada seria irrealizable para ellos. Bien conscientes del proposito del Partido de convertir a todos ellos en trabajadores de conocimientos y talentos cientificos y tecnicos, estudiaran con aplicacion a traves del sistema educacional para trabajadores como la ensenanza a distancia adquiriendo modernas ciencias y tecnologia y elevando de continuo el nivel de cultura y conocimientos. Les incumbe superar el empirismo y el misticismo tecnico y contribuir mas al desarrollo cientifico y tecnico de su unidad y a la construccion de la economia del conocimiento con nuevos inventos y valiosa renovacion tecnica. Las organizaciones sindicales deben conducir a sus integrantes y los obreros a que sean precursores en la formacion cientifica y tecnica de todo el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNormalizaran entre los obreros y demas miembros las actividades deportivas, culturales y artisticas y activaran el establecimiento de la cultura en la produccion y la vida, a fin de crear la nueva cultura de la clase obrera y animar el ambiente social.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl movimiento masivo es un instrumento eficaz para imprimir con la innovacion colectiva un auge continuo en la construccion socialista. A las organizaciones sindicales les atane fomentar diversos movimientos como los de la emulacion socialista, de la innovacion tecnica de masas, de maquina ejemplar para aprender del torno No.26 y de los trabajos utiles en correspondencia a la demanda de la realidad en que la construccion de la potencia socialista ha alcanzado un nuevo peldano, de manera que los obreros y otros integrantes dediquen toda su pasion e inteligencia a la construccion socialista. Al enfocarse en el cumplimiento de las tareas estrategicas planteadas por el VII Congreso del Partido y reflejar la aspiracion y el deseo de las masas, trazaran metas elevadas y se esforzaran con teson para alcanzarlas, con miras a poner de pleno manifiesto la vitalidad del movimiento masivo. Les atane dar a conocer claramente a los obreros y otros miembros el objetivo de dicho movimiento y la manera de desarrollarlo, generalizar los ejemplos positivos y hacer un correcto balance y evaluacion, con vistas a despertar la atencion y el afan del movimiento y caldear el ambiente social.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmpenarse en lograr la reunificacion independiente de la patria y la independencia en el mundo es una tarea importante que enfrentan la clase obrera y la Federacion General de los Sindicatos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConoceran a fondo la linea y la orientacion de nuestro Partido sobre la reunificacion independiente del pais y seran los primeros en ponerlas en practica. Apoyaran la lucha antiyanqui de los obreros surcoreanos por la independencia, la democratizacion de la sociedad y el derecho a la existencia y, bajo el ideal de Entre nosotros, los connacionales, lograran la solidaridad y alianza con los sindicatos surcoreanos para abrir el camino de la reintegracion independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Federacion apoyara y materializara el ideal y principio de nuestro Partido respecto a la politica exterior, estimulara a los pueblos progresistas del mundo en su lucha por la independencia, la paz y el socialismo y ampliara las relaciones de buena vecindad, amistad y cooperacion con los sindicatos y otras asociaciones de obreros de varios paises y las organizaciones sindicales internacionales, engrosando las filas de partidarios y simpatizantes con nuestra revolucion y anticipando la independencia a escala mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara cumplir con exito las tareas que tiene por delante, debe fortalecer sus organizaciones a todos los niveles y elevar su funcion y papel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstructurara firmemente sus organos de direccion y les exigira a sus miembros cumplir con su responsabilidad. Los organos de direccion de la Federacion a todas las instancias se integraran no solo por cuadros sindicales, administrativos y economicos sino tambien por un buen numero de obreros ejemplares. Tomaran medidas decisivas para cumplir las tareas asignadas a sus organizaciones y daran regularmente los cometidos a los miembros de sus comites como una manera de dinamizar sus actividades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa clave en la renovacion de las labores de la Federacion esta en el papel de sus entidades primarias como la organizacion de base. Dichas entidades son unidades principales que realizan las orientaciones dadas a la Federacion por el Partido. Les incumbe prestar atencion primordial a la labor con sus miembros, aglutinar compactamente a todos ellos en torno al Partido y convocarlos a la ejecucion de su politica. Trabajaran bien con los miembros ejemplares y activistas, de manera que eduquen y reformen a las masas con el metodo de instruir uno a diez y diez a ciento, y fortaleceran sus organizaciones. A los miembros sindicales que cometen errores en la vida publica y privada los educaran y los ayudaran sinceramente aunque ello suponga un gran esfuerzo, de suerte que todos ellos esten a la altura de la realidad palpitante. Es preciso impulsar con vigor el movimiento por el titulo del colectivo ejemplar de lealtad y fomentar el de adelantar a otros, el de aprender de ellosyel de intercambio de experiencias, de manera que actuen con vigor todas las organizaciones primarias y se anime toda la Federacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que elevar el papel de los comites sindicales en provincias, ciudades y distritos. Como unidades de direccion regionales, los de provincias estableceran un ordenado sistema de direccion de la vida de sus miembros e intensificaran el control y la direccion sobre sus dependencias para transformarlas en vigorosas entidades politicas. Los de ciudades y distritos se centraran en los asuntos internos y en el trabajo con las organizaciones de base, en un intento de elevar constantemente la combatividad de sus agrupaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comite Central de la Federacion es un estado mayor que bajo la direccion del Partido programa y orienta de manera unificada el conjunto de las actividades sindicales. Tomara por su unica guia los legados de los grandes Lideres y la orientacion del Partido, subordinara todas las faenas a su materializacion, se esmerara en las operaciones de combinacion y cooperacion de los departamentos y secciones y controlara y dirigira sustancialmente a las instancias inferiores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa combatividad y el papel de las organizaciones sindicales dependen en gran medida de la preparacion y el metodo de trabajo de los cuadros encargados de organizar y dirigir sus actividades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso elevar el nivel de preparacion politica y profesional de los dirigentes sindicales. Deben identificarse plenamente con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo, conocer al dedillo los legados de los grandes Lideres y la politica del Partido para las actividades de su sector y hacer de ellos una fe inquebrantable. Se prepararan como politicos competentes versados en los asuntos sindicales y que sepan organizar y desarrollar el trabajo de manera activa y creadora. Poseeran conocimientos multifaceticos como los ultimos adelantos cientificos y tecnicos y un alto nivel cultural y trabajaran con gran habilidad con las masas en su intima convivencia con ellas, instandolas a correr a la velocidad de Mallima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsimilaran a fondo el metodo de trabajo del gran General          Kim Jong Il y lo llevaran a la practica. Aprenderan de su buen ejemplo en la educacion y direccion de las masas y se atendran estrictamente a sus ensenanzas. Se habituaran a bajar a instancias inferiores y convivir con las masas ayudandolas y conduciendolas. Abandonaran decididamente el viejo y anacronico metodo de trabajo de limitarse a transmitir las indicaciones del Partido a las instancias inferiores o dedicarse unicamente a las reuniones y la documentacion como si fueran el conjunto de las actividades de la Federacion y, siempre en pleno contacto con las masas, sembraran con sus propias manos y recogeran el fruto de sus esfuerzos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las organizaciones del Partido les corresponde conceder importancia y brindar apoyo a las actividades de la Federacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntegraran las filas de dirigentes sindicales con hombres que sean fieles al Partido, que disfruten de la confianza de las masas, que se hayan curtido con el trabajo y que sean competentes en su profesion. Prestaran profunda atencion a su educacion para que ellos, bien conscientes de su mision, puedan cumplir satisfactoriamente con su responsabilidad y papel. Entre los miembros de la Federacion que se dedican al trabajo productivo seleccionaran como reservas de cuadros sindicales a los que profesan gran lealtad al Partido y se consideran promesas, y los prepararan de manera sistematica a traves de la practica y los estudios en centros de ensenanza politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario promover la independencia y la creatividad de los sindicatos. Los comites de todos los niveles del Partido les daran a conocer a tiempo las orientaciones del Partido para cada etapa, de modo que laboren y actuen ateniendose a sus ideas y propositos. Las organizaciones del Partido los ayudaran en tomar la iniciativa en el trabajo e impulsarlo con arrojo. Dejaran de suplir a los sindicatos en las labores, confiaran con audacia tareas importantes a sus dirigentes y los ayudaran a que las cumplen por si mismos. Crearan optimas condiciones de trabajo para ellos y los enalteceran y apreciaran, de manera que con alto orgullo y dignidad rindan mas en sus faenas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los obreros redoblan los esfuerzos y los sindicatos cobran mayor vigor y animo, las potencialidades de nuestras tropas revolucionarias se multiplicaran y avanzaremos mas en la construccion de la potencia socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstoy firmemente convencido de que todos los trabajadores y organizaciones y miembros de la Federacion, fieles a la noble idea de los grandes Lideres, cumpliran infaliblemente la honrosa mision y deber que le imponen la patria y la revolucion, para demostrar plenamente el espiritu heroico de la clase obrera de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il y contribuir de modo destacado a lograr con anticipacion la victoria definitiva en la construccion de la potencia socialista."
