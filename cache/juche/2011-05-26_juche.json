Hu Jintao stressed that Kim Jong Il's appraisal of the changes taking place in China, making a long trip to the Northeastern and Huadong regions of China, was boundless encouragement and full support to the struggle of the Chinese people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il said that he was pleased to meet Hu Jintao again and expressed deep thanks to him for having sent senior officials in the capital as far as the railway station on the border to warmly receive and accord him cordial hospitality during his visit.

the rapidly changing land of China through the achievements made in the economic and cultural fields and in the domain of the cutting-edge science and technology in its vast land. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The top leaders of the two parties and countries informed each other of the situation in their countries and had an open-hearted exchange of views on boosting the relations between the two parties and countries and reached a full consensus of views in a comradely, sincere and friendly atmosphere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They shared the view that it is the common sacred responsibility which no others can perform instead and steadfast stand to carry forward and develop down through generations the DPRK-China friendly and cooperative relations which have covered the 60 odd year-long proud and historic path and have been put on a new higher stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They recognized that according to the agreement the leaders of the two parties and countries reached after their meeting in Changchun last year the governments and peoples of the two countries have striven to put the issues into practice in various fields. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is favorable for more dynamically pushing forward socialist construction in the two countries, better protecting and promoting the common interests of the two sides and regional peace, stability and prosperity to boost the bilateral relations in various fields including high-level visits, brisk exchange of human culture and expansion of experience swap and mutually beneficial cooperation, they said, and discussed a series of measures to this end and reached an agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the requirement of a new period and new situation to strengthen the unity between the two parties and countries and advance the bilateral friendly and cooperative relations with the era, Hu Jintao said, noting that the CPC and the PRC government will creditably discharge the historic responsibility for steadfastly carrying forward the baton of the traditional Sino-DPRK friendship associated with the noble soul of the revolutionaries of the elder generation of the two countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Chinese side is set to inject fresh life and viability into the Sino-DPRK friendship and promote and put spurs to the development of the Sino-DPRK good neighborly relations of friendship and cooperation and boost them in wider dimension by pooling efforts with the DPRK side and thus bring greater wellbeing to the two countries and peoples and make a greater contribution to peace, stability and prosperity in Northeast Asia and, furthermore, in the rest of the world, Hu Jintao noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK-China friendship with a long history and tradition with the two countries linked by the same mountain and rivers is unbreakable as it stood all storms and tests and it will remain evergreen no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how frequently one generation is replaced by another, Kim Jong Il said, re-clarifying the invariable will and determination of the WPK  and the DPRK government to boost the friendly and cooperative relations in conformity with the noble intention of the leaders of the elder generation of the two countries and the desire of the two peoples. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il expressed thanks to the party and government of China for having consistently set store by the DPRK-China friendship in the light of the strategic importance and from a prospective angle and having positively supported the Korean people in their struggle to defend socialism and achieve the prosperity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He reiterated the will to exert every possible effort for further consolidating the bonds of fraternal friendship enshrined in the minds of the two peoples and dynamically boosting the bilateral friendship, the common treasure of the two countries, in various fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Appreciating the new successes being made by the Chinese people in the efforts to accomplish the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said that the Korean people are rejoiced as over their own success over the fact that everything is going well in China, their neighbor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the talks the two sides highly estimated the fact that the good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation between the two countries grew stronger after a series of historic meetings held between the top leaders of the DPRK and China in recent years and expressed mutual support and solidarity with the two parties and peoples in the struggle for socialist construction and national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu Jintao highly appreciated the positive measures taken by the DPRK to defend stability and peace, develop economy and improve the standard of people's living, wishing the Korean people greater success in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the WPK led by Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He supported the Party, government and people of the DPRK firmly preserving socialism and exploring the road of development suited to its reality, expressing belief that the whole Party, the country and the people would achieve shining successes through a dynamic struggle, single-mindedly united around Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il expressed expectation that the Chinese people would win steady new victories in the historical course of furthering the building of the party's ability to govern, realizing scientific outlook on development and building a harmonious society under the guidance of the CPC with Hu Jintao as its general secretary, wishing them signal achievements this year, the first year of the 12th five-year plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Both sides had a sincere and in-depth exchange of views on international and regional issues of mutual concern, the situation in Northeast Asia, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recognizing that the adherence to the goal of denuclearization on the whole Korean Peninsula, peaceful settlement of the issue through dialogue including the resumption of the six-party talks and the elimination of obstructive elements conform to the overall interests of Northeast Asia, the two sides shared views on making good understanding and coordination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu Jintao hosted a banquet in welcome of Kim Jong Il's China visit at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday

such as Chinese songs \"My Motherland\", serial songs of \"A Dream of Red Mansions\", world famous music and Korean songs \"Nostalgia\" and \"Blooming Worksite\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Kim Jong Il conveyed a floral basket in congratulation of the successful performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He exchanged warm farewell with the leading officials of the collective leadership of China including Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoping to meet Kim Jong Il again, Hu Jintao wished him greater success in his important work for realizing the cause of building a rich and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il met with Premier of the State Council Wen Jiabao and had a cordial conversation with him at the state guest house on May 25.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wen

Sufrio una gran derrota en las elecciones suplementarias del 27 de abril mientras  llega a la fase de explosion la indignacion de la poblacion surcoreana por el actual \"poder\" conservador. \n\t\t\t\t\t Entre tanto, en el seno del \"Gran Partido Nacional\" se arma una trifulca para imputar la responsabilidad por el descalabro electoral. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esta situacion miserable es producto inevitable de las politicas antipopulares de los actuales gobernantes surcoreanos, opina el diario Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual de este jueves y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La causa principal de la crisis de dominacion, que sufren las autoridades surcoreanas, esta en su politica vendepatria, antipopular y servil a grandes potencias y en sus campanas de confrontacion fratricida de caracter anti-reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En lo contrario a las promesas de la banda de conservadores surcoreanos de que \"aliviaria las penas de la vida del pueblo\" y \"seria el ´gobierno´ que infunda esperanza en la poblacion humilde\", quedo depauperada a mas no poder la vida de los habitantes surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por ejemplo, los ingresos de los ricos superan ahora 29 veces los de los extremadamente pobres frente a 5.7 veces de hace una decada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es natural que llegara al climax la indignacion de la poblacion surcoreana por las actuales autoridades conservadoras que practican las politicas antipopulares enganando al pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, ellas se mueven desesperadamente para retomar el poder al remediar la crisis de dominacion en curso de agravacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, el pueblo surcoreano no lo permitira nunca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El criminal sera enjuiciado tarde o temprano."

De esta manera, desestabilizan los paises progresistas e instigan abiertamente el derrocamiento de sus regimenes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los blancos principales de la campana mediatica de los imperialistas son sus rivales y los paises independientes y antiimperialistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A traves de las actividades informativas, los paises no alineados y los en vias de desarrollo deben dar a conocer ampliamente la lucha justa de los pueblos por la independencia, la libertad y el progreso social y alzar las voces de solidaridad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Igualmente, tienen que revelar y denunciar la dominacion, la intervencion, las agresiones y las guerras de toda indole que violan la libertad y los derechos del ser humano y la soberania del pais y la nacion, amenazan y perturban la paz mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para este fin, deben desarrollar el intercambio y la cooperacion internacional en el sector de informacion."
