Irony is that NATO is playing into the hands of the Park Geun Hye regime breathing its last due to the unprecedented hideous scandal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, the Park Geun Hye group only parroted what was uttered by the U.S. master and particularly by the \"divination omen\" made by a shaman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the chief for diplomatic planning for north's nuclear program of the south Korean Foreign Ministry at a briefing in Seoul said that Europe is within the firing range of north Korean missiles and NATO has become a target as a whole, only to make fool of himself as he failed to answer questions raised by reporters demanding presentation of evidence proving the accuracy of information. This is by no means accidental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chris Ogden, an expert on security in Asia of Saint Andrewes University of Britain, held that key rivals of north Korea are south Korea, the U.S. and Japan, not Europe, adding the \"story of threat to Europe by north Korean missiles\" can be an exaggerated propaganda for getting diplomatic effect. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those with no insight into the trend of the times and without principle are bound to be treated as fool.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves for building armed forces independent of NATO being pushed forward by the European Union point to the international community's stand on NATO and its worth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present unequal international relations swayed over by strength and high-handedness, to build strength for defending the country's sovereignty and right to existence is a full-fledged right of a sovereign state no one can deny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t NATO, a body bereft of independence and playing into the hands of the south Korean puppet forces, should not say this or that about the DPRK as it is unaware of the essence of the issue, but had better stop functioning as a tool harassing international peace and security."

These are the thrice-cursed crimes committed by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The candlelight actions sweeping across south Korea have already passed a severe judgment on traitor Park Geun Hye and sentenced her treacherous policy to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the group of conservatives are desperately sticking to the confrontation policy without any guilty conscience and sense of reflection. Their behavior amounts to act of challenging the aspiration of the nation and the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proved by history, confrontation between fellow countrymen is the road to treachery and all those who sought a way out in confrontation suffered destruction without exception.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that south Koreans from all walks of life brand Hwang Kyo An as \"second Park Geun Hye\" and Yun Pyong Se, Hong Yong Phyo and so on as top-class guardians of Park and accomplices in the extra-large scandal and demand they be brought to the court of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who followed the confrontation policy of the witch of Chongwadae are doomed to ruin."

Y en el presupuesto estatal del ano nuevo, que se aprobara dentro de unos dias, se asignaran como fondos para la defensa 5 billones y 100 mil millones de yenes (moneda japonesa), cifra mas alta en su historia. Y una parte medular para la defensa nacional es la formacion del sistema antimisiles contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo vemos, Japon intenta utilizar la \"amenaza de misil\" de la RPDC como un pretexto de su aumento armamentista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHablando ruidosamente de la inexistente \"amenaza de misil\" de la RPDC, el pais insular intenta sembrar en la poblacion la inquietud de seguridad y aprovecharlo para dar acicate a los preparativos de agresion militarista a ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no se sale con la suya tal intencion del pais isleno. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sociedad internacional incluso los paises vecinos de Japon expresan grave precaucion por las maniobras de Japon destinadas a realizar la reagresion, que perturban la paz y la estabilidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Japon sigue recurriendo como ahora a las maniobras de provocacion de guerra despreciando la demanda de la sociedad internacional, sufrira la autodestruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los reaccionarios japoneses desean de veras la seguridad de su archipielago, han de actuar con prudencia."
