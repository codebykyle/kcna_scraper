Boundless was such love shown by the President for the younger generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He placed the matter of children's pencil on the agenda of the First Session of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea after the liberation of the country. When he saw a barefoot boy on the way of field guidance, he called at his house and bought shoes for him. He donated his saved living expenses to the construction of a school in Hyangsan County.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In accordance with his outlook on the rising generation, the state built schools for bereaved children of patriotic martyrs and orphanages across the country and the schools did not suspend lessons during the Fatherland Liberation War. In the postwar rehabilitation and construction, too, the priority was given to the construction of schools, students and children's palaces, students and children's halls and children's camps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that he was very happy when he was among children, the President watched schoolchildren's New Year performances for scores of years. He acquainted himself with the supply of the new school uniforms to the students at the historical consultation meeting of officials in the economic sectors in July Juche 83 (1994), the last days of his life, and expressed great satisfaction. Indeed, he was the true father of the younger generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the leadership of Kim Jong Il who is identical to the President, similar legends of love for the rising generation are being created without let-up in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While finding himself on the way of frontline inspection in the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march, he let camping flags fly on the poles of the children's camps and saw to it that the facilities of the bean-milk factories were replaced with modern ones and bean-milk-carrying vans were sent for the children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He took a measure to send specimens of animals and plants prepared by servicepersons of the Korean People’s Army to educational sectors, inspected a class at work at the Mubong Secondary School in Samjiyon County and sent educational apparatuses to the Sojung Secondary School in Rakwon County some time ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Greeting the 63rd anniversary of the foundation of the Korean Children's Union (June 6, 1946) the KCU members are making up their minds to carry forward the lineage of the Juche-oriented revolution."

It was the President who founded the Saenal Children's Union right after he embarked upon the road of revolution and established the glorious tradition of the Juche-based juvenile movement. He founded the KCU, the successor to the tradition of the anti-Japanese Children's Corps on June 6, Juche 35 (1946). This marked a significant event which laid a new landmark in strengthening the Juche-based juvenile movement and steadily advancing the Korean revolution generation after generation. He made sure that the pencil issue was discussed as the item of the agenda of the first meeting of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea after the liberation of the country and a children's camp was built on a picturesque shore of the East Sea at a time when the situation of the country was so difficult after the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  These facts clearly indicate what profound loving care he showed for the children, the future of the country. He attended the 5th Congress of the KCU and bestowed such honor upon the members of the KCU as having a picture taken with them and showed his boundless loving care for the children till the last moments of his life. This loving care will always be remembered by the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undying feats performed by him in strengthening the Korean juvenile movement continue shining brilliantly under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He published many works including \"On Improving Guidance of Children's Union Work\" and led the work of the KCU with warm care. Bean-based milk vans associated with his loving care run along streets of the capital on a regular basis and there sprang up modern bases for training computer talents, bases for extracurricular education and children's camps during the \"Arduous March\" when everything was in short supply. This would be unthinkable without his noble view on the future of the country as he spares nothing for the younger generation. The members of the KCU are stoutly growing to be the reserves of the Songun revolution, their hopes in full bloom under such profound loving care."

del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, dirigio en el terreno las fabricas y empresas de la ciudad de Tanchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t  El estuvo primero en la Fabrica de Magnesia de Tanchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Guiado por los funcionarios directivos de la fabrica, recorrio ante todo el monumento a la visita de orientacion del Presidente Kim Il Sung y la sala de presentacion del historial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras recordar con profunda emocion la trayectoria orgullosa de la fabrica, dijo que bajo la sabia direccion y atencion minuciosa del Presidente, ella se convirtio en una macro-base combinada de produccion de materiales refractarios y subrayo que las inmortales hazanas revolucionarias del Presidente brillaran eternamente en los anales de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, se cercioro del estado de equipos tecnicos y produccion pasando revista a los procesos productivos como el taller de fusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aprecio mucho los exitos logrados por los obreros de la fabrica en el pasado mostrandose muy satisfecho de que ellos hicieron gran aporte al desarrollo industrial del pais aumentando incesantemente la produccion del clinker de magnesia de buena calidad y especialmente, realizan este trabajo segun metodos autoctonos, al luchar tenazmente guardando en el corazon el legado del Presidente de desarrollar en gran escala la autoctona industria del clinker de magnesia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTiene buenas perspectivas de desarrollo esa industria fundada por el Presidente porque se basa en la inagotable fuente de materias primas, alta tecnologia y abundantes experiencias, destaco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnadio que se debe seguir intensificando la investigacion cientifica de esa rama y organizar escrupulosamente la produccion para producir mayor cantidad de varios materiales refractarios y magnesia ligeramente cocida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA continuacion, el Dirigente se traslado a la Fundicion de Metales No Ferrosos de Tanchon reconstruida modernamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de escuchar las explicaciones sobre los problemas tecnicos resueltos ahi por cuenta propia, estuvo en la sala de mando general de la produccion y otros lugares averiguando en detalles el estado de produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElogio mucho los meritos de los obreros de ahi poniendose muy complacido de que despues de edificar magnificamente esta fundicion ultramoderna, ellos lograron un brillante progreso tecnico al desarrollar activamente el movimiento por la innovacion tecnica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDiciendo que la Fundicion de Metales No Ferrosos de Tanchon, que abrio la brecha amplia del auge productivo al desarrollar continuamente la tecnologia, es una fabrica ejemplar en lo cientifico-tecnico, recalco que la orgullosa transformacion de ella constituye un manifiesto patente de la justeza y vitalidad de la orientacion de nuestro partido sobre la revolucion tecnica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresento las tareas que incumben a esta empresa senalando que ella ocupa un lugar importante en la construccion de una potencia economica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMas tarde, el Dirigente Kim Jong Il dirigio en el terreno la Fabrica de Maquinas de Minas de Tanchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras escuchar explicaciones ante el plano de la fabrica, se entero en detalles del estado de construccion y equipos tecnicos recorriendo los procesos productivos como el taller de elaboracion de gran dimension y el de paileria bajo techo asi como los establecimientos culturales y de servicio publico edificados confortablemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La clase obrera de esta planta, que habia fabricado desde el cero muchas maquinas herramientas en el dificil tiempo posbelico, termino con brillantez la modernizacion de la fabrica con el espiritu y temperamento de aquel tiempo, destaco y prosiguio que esto es una muestra directa del espiritu revolucionario de los obreros coreanos, combatientes dispuestos a implementar a costa de la vida cualquier cosa, por muy dificil que fuera, que les pida el partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo que las modernas fabricas y empresas acondicionadas en la ciudad de Tanchon son la parte reducida del orgulloso aspecto de la industria autoctona en que se realiza brillantemente la transformacion tecnica general basada en las tecnologias de punta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a la solida base industrial al estilo coreano,  avanzamos victoriosamente sin vacilacion alguna ante cualquier fluctuacion economica de alcance global y es definitiva la victoria de la causa de construccion de una gran potencia prospera, subrayo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntre los acompanantes del Dirigente figuraban el secretario del CC del PTC, Kim Ki Nam, y los jefes de departamento del CC del PTC, Pak Nam Gi y Jang Song Thaek."
