He heard a story about the efforts made by the workers to tend the forest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Saying that such work can yield fruits only ten years or dozens of years later, he stressed that this can be done only by a true patriot who devotes himself to the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the generations to come. He highly appreciated the noble patriotic spirit displayed by Choe Ki Jong, former head of the Forest Management Station, who made his life rewarding along with the forest for years and other officials and workers of the station. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The experience gained by the Riwon County Forest Management Station has proved in practice the truth and tremendous vitality of the great Juche idea that calls for transforming man, society and nature as required by Juche, he said, stressing that there is nothing impossible in this world when the creative ingenuity of people is given fullest play. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can turn all the mountains of the country into thick woodlands in a brief span of time if we make tenacious efforts to change the appearance of the mountains and rivers of the country just as the Riwon County Forest Management Station did, he said, setting forth on the spot tasks to be fulfilled to create forests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He noted that in order to turn the whole country into a thick woodland and greenery it is necessary to plant many trees and pay deep attention to protecting and managing forests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed the need for the scientific research institutions to obtain saplings of good species which are of economic value and suited the climatic and soil conditions of the country and actively push forward the research work to widely disseminate them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on the whole party and  army and all the people to turn out as one to wage a dynamic drive to create forests in order to convey the land which has been covered with thick forests and which has turned into \"mountains of gold and treasures\" down  to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KPA Panmunjom Mission Issues Detailed Report \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- The Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army released the following detailed report Friday dismissing the sophism let loose by the United States that the already demised Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) still exists: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. put out of existence the NNSC, a mechanism tasked to oversee the implementation of the Armistice Agreement (AA), which it regarded as a hurdle in the way of turning south Korea into the world's biggest nuclear base and making preparations for launching a new war, and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams affiliated to it long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it still keeps Swiss and Swedish members of the former NNSC at Panmunjom in a bid to make the world public believe that it still exists, a poor charade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side is busy manipulating those members to meet at Panmunjom almost everyday although it met once every Tuesday. It is also egging them on to conduct \"diplomacy for eliciting sympathy\" from tourists coming to Panmunjom, asking them to receive texts of the so-called \"letter\" near the Military Demarcation Line for several hours though it was flatly rejected by the KPA side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side went the lengths of letting them guide tourists in Panmunjom and watch the take-off and landing exercises of the U.S. forces copters in the area of the conference hall and participate in a \"memorial service\" for the U.S. soldier, etc. in a clumsy bid to convince the public that the commission still exists and is active. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even in Europe personnel of the member nations of the former NNSC met as an annual event at which they talked rubbish that they would continue to fulfill their commitments under the AA at the prodding of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NNSC was an international mechanism set up at Panmunjom on August 1, 1953 according to Paragraph 36 of the AA. Its basic mission was to oversee the implementation of Paragraph 13 d of the AA which bans two belligerent parties from introducing armed forces from outside Korea in order to prevent the recurrence of fresh armed conflict in Korea after ceasefire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the NNSC was left intact, it was quite impossible for the U.S. to rapidly modernize the equipment of its forces in south Korea nor was it possible for it to introduce nuclear weapons the shipment of which was stepped up according to its \"big-scale retaliation\" strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hence, the U.S. forces side obstructed the supervision and watch by the NNSC and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the build-up of its forces and violations of the AA were brought to light, the U.S. forces side forcibly expelled the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams from the area of its side on June 9, 1956 and officially declared that it unilaterally abandoned the implementation of Paragraph 13 d of the AA at the 75th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) on June 21, 1957. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the NNSC existed only in name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side appointed a general of the south Korean puppet army which was not a signatory to the AA and which had neither qualification nor mandate to handle issues related to the AA as senior member of its side to the MAC in gross violation of the Paragraph 20 of Article 2 of the AA on March 25, 1991, thus compelling the MAC to suspend its activities and depriving the NNSC of the mechanism to work with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNSC pulled out of Panmunjom and their countries joined the U.S.-led NATO, thus losing neutrality. This caused the NNSC which existed only in name to completely collapse. This being a hard reality, the U.S. is working hard to create the impression that the NNSC still exists. This is intended to achieve its sinister aims to justify the existence of the \"UN Command\" as a signatory to the AA in a bid to secure a legal ground for rapidly and automatically hurling multinational forces a Korean war in contingency on the Korean Peninsula and shift the blame for the collapse of the mechanism to oversee the implementation of the AA onto the DPRK by using Swiss and Swedish personnel as \"witnesses.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no crafty machinations, however can the U.S. evade the responsibility for destroying the NNSC and sparking off the nuclear crisis on the peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has not only systematically disturbed the work of the NNSC but turned south Korea into its nuclear arsenal and forward logistic base in the true sense of the word by massively introducing all types of operational equipment and nuclear weapons. It has ceaselessly staged exercises for a nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This sparked off a nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula and forced the Korean people to live, being exposed to the constant nuclear threat of the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its satellite forces are escalating sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK, claiming in unison that the nuclear issue was spawned on the peninsula because the DPRK built a nuclear power base and war deterrent for self-defence to cope with the threat of nuclear attack from the U.S. This is nonsensical, indeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean People's Army is now standing in confrontation with the U.S. forces which have massively stockpiled various types of nuclear weapons in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are not the spiritless people who sit idle, waiting for a lucky chance and mercy after being deterred by the U.S. nuclear blackmail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks that it can bring the Korean people to their knees with threat, arbitrary practices, sanctions and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sanctions and pressure of the U.S. and its satellite states can never work on the army and people of the DPRK who regard sovereignty as their life and soul and no one can encroach upon the system and sovereign dignity of the DPRK under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that the DPRK was entirely right when it built the self-defensive military power at a required level to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its pipedream to achieve its sinister aim by using the ghost-like \"NNSC\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only right way of promoting lasting peace and stability on the peninsula at present to replace the AA by a peace accord and build a new peace-keeping mechanism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They clearly prove that the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces are, indeed, beasts in human skin and a group of bandits who completely disregard international law and humanitarianism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. is resorting to crafty moves to evade the responsibility for the massacres while covering up and justifying them, claiming that they were \"accidental\" though more than half a century has passed since the ceasefire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also keeping its forces in south Korea and committing violence, plunder, rape and man-killings every day, bringing untold misfortune and sufferings to its people. And it is busy with the moves for provoking another war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves for aggression on the DPRK and massacres of civilians perpetrated by it century after century are connived at and overlooked still today when the war crimes in which wars of aggression were started and innocent civilians were killed are being severely punished worldwide after becoming targets of stern judgment, not bound to the statute of limitations. This is an unpardonable insult to justice and human conscience and an intolerable violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should turn out more vigorously in the struggle to force the U.S. to pay for all the brutal killings of Koreans and put an end to its military presence in south Korea and its hostile actions against the DPRK in order to preserve the dignity and honor of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu to the area of the Rangrim Mountain Range and, in reliance upon it, bringing the Korean revolution as a whole centering on the anti-Japanese armed struggle to a great upswing and dispatched a small unit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and political workers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He came to the Wagalbong Secret Camp, the main one of the secret base of Mt. Rangrim, in August 1938. There he said the secret base should play the role of the regional leading base for ensuring the armed struggle and other forms of anti-Japanese struggle conducted under the unified leadership of the headquarters of the revolution such as the armed struggle, the work for building party organizations and expanding and strengthening the Fatherland Restoration Association as well as preparations for an all-people resistance, and  a base of the actions and operations of KPRA units and their logistic base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He came to the Wagalbong Secret Camp again in September and convened a meeting of members of the small unit of KPRA and political workers active in the Mt. Rangrim area, at which he set forth the tasks to put fresh muscles into the secret base and build up a sturdy force of all-people resistance by forming various organizations including a para-military organization in the area and give effective aid to the guerrilla army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the other hand, he taught a detailed work method to the members of the small unit and political workers of the secret base and met members of organizations and people in the area and encouraged them to turn out in the fight against the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many revolutionary organizations and para-military organizations including the Anti-Japanese Workers' Association and the Workers' Shock Brigade came into being in Rangrim County in the first half of the 1940s under the wise guidance of President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the immortal footmarks left by the President in the area of Mt.

It even marked the River Amnok as one of China and the River Tuman estuary as one of Russia on Internet site. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the reason why the U.S. has shown such great \"interest\" in the geographical designation of various places of the world for such a long time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As early as in 1977 the above-said board deliberately changed the name of Tok Islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, thus inviting censure and derision from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In July it marked the islet as an area of undesignated sovereignty, sparking off such strong criticism that it had no option but to retract it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Congress Library also attempted to deliberately change the name of Tok Islet on an official map some time ago only to spark off a public furor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves in the eyes of the world that American institutions that claim to study the geographical names of countries of the world and its maps are pseudo organs made up of imbeciles and fools utterly ignorant of world geography. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess how things would go well in the U.S. as it shapes its policies counting on such guys changing names of places of various countries as they please only to provoke laughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Geographical designation has long spawned serious political problems worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In deliberately misusing geographical names of various places some institutions of the U.S. seek an ulterior motive to render the situation in Northeast Asia extremely tense and trigger off disputes there in a bid to fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior on the part of the U.S. reminds one of what it did more than a century ago when it recognized the Korean Peninsula as a region under the Japanese rule and fabricated the \"Taft-Katsura Agreement\" with the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We state loud and clear that the geographical names of all areas of Korea are the issues concerning the eternal cradle of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This conception is nothing but a leftover of the old era as it diametrically runs counter to the June 15 era of reunification and it should be discarded as early as possible for the development of the inter-Korean relations and the progress in the reunification cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the theory of \"principal enemy\", an anachronistic confrontational conception, is openly advocated in south Korea, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group should never be allowed to pursue their treacherous anti-reunification moves to do harm to the fellow countrymen, prompted by the above-said conception in contravention of the principle of national independence and the idea of \"By our nation itself\", its embodiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification when the Koreans are striving to achieve the independent reunification, peace and prosperity by their concerted efforts calls for doing away with the above-mentioned conception and achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country as early as possible in the spirit of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should give fuller play to the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" and intensify the just patriotic struggle to denounce and foil the Lee Myung Bak group's moves to bring the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe on the basis of the above-said confrontational conception, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Trabajo de Corea y Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, dirigio sobre el terreno la Planta Porcina de Hamju y la Granja de Cabras Phyongphungdok de Hamju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente estuvo primero en la nuevamente construida Planta Porcina de Hamju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Luego de escuchar explicaciones ante el plano de la planta, recorrio el exterior y el interior de ella averiguando en detalles el estado de construccion y cria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Evaluo altamente los meritos de los constructores y voluntarios mostrandose muy satisfecho de que la provincia de Hamgyong del Sur construyo magnificamente por cuenta propia esta moderna base ganadera de gran capacidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEncomio la abnegacion patriotica de los funcionarios y constructores, que edificaron esta base ganadera de eterna duracion al servicio del pueblo, subrayando que ella esta situada en un buen lugar y se construyo cualitativamente, en particular, se diseno bien de modo que pudiera elevar la eficacia del pienso y su transporte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En varios lugares incluyendo la sala de elaboracion del pienso y el corral de ceba hizo conocimiento de las condiciones de equipos tecnicos y la situacion de la cria y estimulo a los empleados que trabajan con mucha dedicacion para suministrar mas carne al pueblo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Dijo que el salto de la produccion de la planta de patos de Kwangpho y la construccion en la zona de Hamhung de otra moderna planta porcina permiten suministrar mas carne a la clase obrera de esta ciudad y otros habitantes de la provincia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIndico las tareas para normalizar la produccion de la Planta Porcina de Hamju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Acto seguido, el Dirigente Kim Jong Il visito la Granja de Cabras Phyongphungdok de Hamju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esta orgullosa granja de gran dimension, extendida en la vasta meseta de Phyongphungdok del distrito de Hamju, tiene 24 granjas anexas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tras escuchar explicaciones ante el plano de la granja, recorrio la sala de elaboracion de leche, el corral de cabras y otras instalaciones de produccion, y la Escuela de Phungdok anexa a la Escuela Secundaria de Phungsong y la Tienda de Phyongphungdok y otras facilidades culturales y de servicio publico cerciorandose del estado de produccion de la granja y la vida de los trabajadores agricolas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la sala de elaboracion de leche, donde se manufactura toda clase de productos lacteos, hizo conocimiento de los equipos de produccion y del metodo de elaboracion expresando gran satisfaccion por este taller acondicionado por cuenta propia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tras recorrer las instalaciones de produccion y de intendencia, disfruto desde un mirador del panorama de la granja. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al ver durante largo tiempo el majestuoso aspecto de la granja parecida a un cuadro, se mostro muy satisfecho de que los militantes del partido y otros trabajadores del distrito de Hamju construyeron esta granja tan excelente en el periodo dificil en que carecia todo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los habitantes distritales desplegaron una dinamica lucha guardando en el corazon la consigna de \"Vivamos no para hoy sino para el manana\" en el periodo de la \"marcha penosa\" y la forzada, cuando nuestra patria atravesaba pruebas mas severas, y por fin, pueden cosechar los frutos de sus duros trabajos, dijo y evaluo altamente sus meritos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Dijo que es prometedora la perspectiva del desarrollo de la granja que cuenta con las favorables condiciones naturales y geograficas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLuego de destacar la necesidad de convertir la granja en una renombrada base de cria de cabras  al promover planeadamente la labor para crear mayor capacidad productiva, tomo medidas que favorecen mucho a la granja e indico las tareas que incumben a ella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La orgullosa realidad de hoy es resultado de que los funcionarios, militantes del partido y los trabajadores de la ciudad de Hamhung y el distrito de Hamju y otras partes de la provincia de Hamgyong del Sur trazaron planes ambiciosos y lucharon con teson en pleno acato a la orientacion del partido de criar en gran medida los ganados herbivoros, resalto y senalo que ellos son precursores orgullosos que comprobaron en la practica la justeza y vigencia de la politica de nuestro partido de criar muchas cabras de alta eficacia economica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy dia, contribuyen a la mejora de la vida alimentaria los productos lacteos elaborados a granel en numerosas granjas de cabras construidas en las unidades del Ejercito Popular de Corea y en la sociedad, asevero y anadio que este cambio asombroso es brillante fruto de la gran epoca del Songun (priorizacion militar). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque hubo muchas dificultades y pruebas en la construccion de las granjas de cabras de gran tamano en la provincia de Hamgyong del Sur, los habitantes de esta la impulsaron hasta el final sin vacilar ni un momento desplegando en alto grado el espiritu revolucionario de los militares y el de lucha tenaz, recalco. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDe esta manera, pudieron lograr el orgulloso exito de ahora, dijo y subrayo que lo mas importante es tal espiritu revolucionario de materializacion a ultranza consistente en cumplir incondicionalmente todo lo que decida el partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Le acompano el secretario del Comite Central del PTC, Kim Ki Nam.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Informacion de la Representacion del EPC en Phanmunjom\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 8 de agosto (ATCC) -- A fin de condenar la artimana de EE.UU. para hacer creer que sigue existiendo la ya desintegrada Comision Supervisora de las Naciones Neutrales (CSNN), la Representacion del Ejercito Popular de Corea en Phanmunjom hizo publica el dia 8 la siguiente informacion detallada: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nYa hace mucho tiempo, EE.UU. convirtio el suelo surcoreano en el mayor arsenal nuclear del mundo y disolvio la CSNN a cargo de controlar la ejecucion del Acuerdo de Armisticio y los grupos de inspeccion de los paises neutrales pertenecientes a ella, que constituian el escollo para la preparacion de la nueva guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPero, EE.UU. esta enganando estos dias a todo el mundo como si existiera todavia la CSNN al mantener enclavados en Phanmunjom a los ex -miembros de Suiza y Suecia de esta entidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUltimamente, la parte de las tropas norteamericanas instigo a estos suizos y suecos para que estos convocaran casi todos los dias la reunion de la CSNN que sesionaba una vez a la semana: cada martes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTambien, les hizo estar de pie durante varias horas en la linea divisoria pidiendonos recibir el \"mensaje\" rechazado tajantemente por nuestra parte y solicitar hasta a los turistas a Phanmunjom sumarse a esta \"diplomacia de compasion\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEn particular, la parte norteamericana incorporo a los suizos y suecos en la guia para los turistas a Phanmunjom, el ejercicio de despegue y aterrizaje de los helicopteros norteamericanos, que se realiza en la zona de sala de reuniones, el \"acto de recordacion\" del soldado norteamericano y otras actividades para simular que si existe y funciona la CSNN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPor otra parte, en Europa se oyen las tonterias de los ciudadanos de los paises ex-miembros de la CSNN, controlados tambien por EE.UU., quienes se reunen anualmente jurando seguir cumpliendo su deber establecido en el Acuerdo de Armisticio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLa CSNN fue una organizacion internacional que fue instaurada el primero de agosto de 1953 en Phanmunjom en virtud del articulo 36 del Acuerdo de Armisticio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSu deber fundamental consistia en controlar y supervisar la ejecucion de la clausula D del articulo 13 del Acuerdo de Armisticio que prohibe a ambas partes la introduccion de mas fuerzas armadas desde el exterior de Corea para prevenir la repeticion del conflicto armado despues del armisticio en Corea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBajo la presencia de la CSNN, EE.UU. no pudo modernizar sus tropas estacionadas en suelo surcoreano ni impulsar la introduccion de armas nucleares segun la \"estrategia de represalia de gran envergadura\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPor esta razon, la parte de las tropas norteamericanas obstaculizaba por todos los medios las actividades de supervision y vigilancia de la CSNN y sus grupos de inspeccion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCuando quedaron revelados sus actos de aumento armamentista y casos de violacion del Acuerdo de Armisticio, deporto el 9 de junio de 1956 a dichos grupos en la zona bajo su control y declaro oficialmente la renuncia unilateral de la ejecucion de la clausula D del articulo 13 del Acuerdo de Armisticio en la 75a reunion de la Comision Militar de Armisticio convocada el 21 de junio de 1957. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDe esta manera, la CSNN se convirtio en una entidad a la que solo quedo su nombre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl 25 de marzo de 1991, violando flagrantemente la clausula 20 del articulo 2 del Acuerdo de Armisticio, la parte estadounidense nombro como miembro-jefe de su parte de la Comision Militar de Armisticio a un general del ejercito titere surcoreano que no es signatario del acuerdo ni tiene calificacion alguna ni facultad de tratar los problemas relacionados con este documento. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDe esta manera, la Comision Militar de Armisticio se vio obligada a interrumpir sus actividades y la CSNN se colapso al desaparecer esta primera entidad con que trabajaba. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPor otra parte, los miembros checoslovacos y polacos de la CSNN se retiraron de Phanmunjom y sus paises ingresaron en la OTAN bajo el liderazgo de EE.UU, lo cual resto a esta entidad su caracter neutral. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSin embargo, EE.UU. recurre a esa marana para dar credulidad a la existencia de la ex CSNN partiendo de su siniestro intento de mantener la razon juridica de la introduccion automatica y rapida de las fuerzas multinacionales en la eventual guerra coreana en los tiempos de emergencia de la Peninsula Coreana al conservar la justificacion de la existencia de la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas de la ONU\" como signataria del Acuerdo de Armisticio y de imputar a nuestra parte la responsabilidad de la disolucion de la CSNN presentando como \"testigo presencial\" a los suizos y suecos senalados arriba. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPero, con tales maniobras astutas EE.UU. no podra liberarse de la responsabilidad de la quiebra de la CSNN y de la crisis nuclear dada en la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, EE.UU. introdujo en gran medida en el Sur de Corea los equipos operacionales y las armas nucleares de todo tipo convirtiendolo en su arsenal de armas nucleares y base logistica de avanzada y desplego incesantes ejercicios belicos nucleares contra la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por esta razon, se creo la crisis nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana y el pueblo coreano vive bajo la constante amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es sumamente absurdo el hecho de que EE.UU. y sus satelites insistieran unanimemente en que el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana  fue surgido como resultado de la fundacion de la base de energia nuclear y la preparacion de las fuerzas disuasorias de guerra con fines de autodefensa frente a la amenaza de ataque nuclear de EE.UU. por parte de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea e intensificaran la sancion y la presion contra ella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy tambien, el Ejercito Popular de Corea esta enfrentandose con las tropas norteamericanas que poseen numerosas armas nucleares de toda indole en el Sur de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El pueblo coreano no es el impotente que ante el chantaje nuclear de EE.UU., espera con brazos cruzados una buena suerte o la clemencia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Seria la tonteria mas grande si EE.UU. piensa que podria doblegar al pueblo coreano mediante la amenaza, el despotismo, la sancion y la presion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al ejercito y pueblo de Corea que consideran como su vida la soberania no valen la pena la sancion y presion de EE.UU. y sus paises seguidores y nadie podra ofender nuestro regimen y nuestra dignidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLa realidad comprueba que fue mil veces justo que la RPDC preparara su capacidad militar de autodefensa en el nivel correspondiente para hacer frente a la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   EE.UU. debe abandonar su absurda ilusion de hacer algo por medio de ese aparato quebrado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. debe tener presente que en la etapa actual, sustituir el Acuerdo de Armisticio con el Tratado de Paz y establecer el nuevo sistema para asegurar la paz constituyen el unico camino justo para fomentar la paz duradera y estabilidad en la Peninsula Coreana.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
