He said that he came to the factory to encourage the disabled soldiers reliably serving at new posts for improving the people's standard of living with patriotism they displayed during military service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the factory before a map showing its panoramic view, he went round a room for the education in the revolutionary history and a room dedicated to the history of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the factory, which was founded as a small unit producing simple ironware with some equipment in October 1970 when the Fifth Congress of the WPK was held, is stepping up production in the van of the whole country. This would have been unthinkable without the meticulous guidance and solicitude of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He kept his eyes for a long time to a photo showing the benevolent image of Kim Jong Il seeing goods at the factory in October 2011, the last period of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round various places of the factory, he learned in detail about its production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing goods one by one, he said that there are varieties of goods and they were made to be useful, adding that the disabled soldiers are excellent in working style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Rangnang Disabled Soldiers' Essential Plastic Goods Factory is a model factory in equipment management, he noted, instructing officials to widely introduce the factory to the whole country and make other factories to learn from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round newly-built welfare service facilities and sci-tech knowledge dissemination room.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that welfare service facilities consisting of public bath, barber's, exercise and treatment recovery room were designed and built well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting he feels they were built with determination, he said with pleasure that the employees of the factory would be very glad at them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that there is nothing to spare for the disabled soldiers, treasure of the country, adding officials should take good care of their life so that they work well in good health. He stressed that all the Party organizations should regard it as their duty and mission to take meticulous care of the disabled soldiers' life so that they do not feel slight troubles and inconvenience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the factory, he could know again that the disabled soldiers are invariably taking the road of struggle for the country and the people as they did during solders' days, in hearty response to the intention of the Party that the disabled soldiers should keep the flower of revolution in bloom, he said. He had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Pak Pong Ju, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the C.C., WPK, vice-chairman of the DPRK State Affairs Commission and premier of the Cabinet, Ri Ju O, vice-premier of the Cabinet, An Jong Su, department director of the C.C., WPK, and Jo Yong Won, vice department director of the C.C., WPK."

In the past the U.S. conducted in secrecy such drill twice a year in spring and autumn on the plea of \"non-combatant evacuation operation\", pursuant to the \"plan for evacuation of civilians\". However, this time the U.S. announced the period of the drill far earlier than usual.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a prelude of a war for invading the DPRK and an open declaration of the U.S. to ignite a war at any moment, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. announced the shady plan for evacuation drill nearly two months earlier to frighten the DPRK. This is a very foolish behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past Korean War, the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces could return to their homes though they were badly beaten. But now if a war breaks out, even survivors cannot seek a shelter anywhere. The U.S. would be well advised to urgently take measures to save the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans in the mainland rather than being concerned about security of those in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is going to flee from south Korea after igniting a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. This is the sinister intention of the U.S. vociferating about \"solid alliance\" with south Korea. That is why the south Korean puppet authorities should not prick their own eyes with their own fingers any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson in an article says that the only way for the U.S. to escape complete destruction is to withdraw not only its civilians but also all the aggressor forces in south Korea if it is fearful of the deadly strike of the DPRK and is concerned about the lives of its citizens."
