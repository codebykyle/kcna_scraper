Korean Authorities Denounced for Following U.S. Policy to Stifle DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities, who repeatedly touted \"ruling out a war,\" firstly expressed \"support\" for the \"sanctions resolution\" of the UN and launched propaganda about the crude \"feats\". This is the revelation of the sinister intention to realize their ambition for invading the north with the backing of the U.S., Minju Joson Sunday says in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities shamelessly vociferate about \"dialogue and peace\". However, can they calm down the strong criticism at home and abroad with such foolish farce?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities suffer an insult and cold treatment, being subject to contempt by the international community owing to the submission to the U.S. They have not yet presumed the horrible ruin entailed by the U.S. and its vassal forces' sanctions, pressure and military provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a world nuclear power, but run amuck.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK sanctions block dialogue and disturb peace only. The former pro-U.S. conservative regime met a miserable end, forsaken by mindset of the people, as it took advantage of the U.S. sanctions against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have still followed the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK, far from drawing a lesson from the miserable end of the predecessor. This is a foolish behavior of bringing about dread self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should follow the trend of the times from the stand of the national independence, coming to their senses, though belatedly."
