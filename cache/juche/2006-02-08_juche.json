Paektu in the glorious 60-year history of the UAWK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung formed a revolutionary peasants organization of Juche type to give birth to the peasants' movement of the independent era in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and then founded the UAWK, a massive political organization of peasants after the liberation of the country. He illuminated the road ahead of the UAWK in every period and at every stage of the developing revolution and wisely led it to resolve the rural issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese war hero, trained the Korean peasants to be masters of soil and builders of a new country and led them to repay the benevolence of Kim Il Sung with increased production of food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il has energetically guided the UAWK to bring about a great revolutionary turn in its work as required by a new high stage of the developing revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He in his famous work \"On Stepping Up the Work of the Union of Agricultural Working People\" elucidated the character and duty of the union, the supreme principle of its building and activities, its tasks and ways of their implementation.\r\n  He has pursued the unique Songun politics and developed the UAWK into a militant organization faithful to the Party's leadership of the Songun revolution.\r\n  The reporter called upon all the UAWK organizations, officials and members to hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem forever as the sun of Juche, devotedly defend Kim Jong Il and uphold the Songun leadership of the Party with loyalty, firmly rallied in one mind around the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Present at the meeting were Vice-Premier of the Cabinet Ro Tu Chol and officials concerned and union officials and exemplary members from the capital city of Pyongyang, provinces, cities and counties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  After the meeting a performance of art groups of agricultural workers from across the country was given.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

No force on earth can stand in their way as they are waging a persevering struggle, always remaining confident of victory and optimistic about future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their great ambition and confidence in victory of the revolution are strikingly manifested in the on-going general march of the Songun revolution. They picture to themselves with pride a more prosperous country that will appear in the future, witnessing the splendid reality in which all the seeds sown and cultivated by leader Kim Jong Il in adversity have yielded abundant fruits, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In a nutshell, the U.S. imperialists' reckless military moves are a revelation of their \"preemptive nuclear attack\" doctrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dangerous military moves of the belligerent Bush group  escalated from the beginning of the year compel the Korean army and people to harden their determination and will to do their best to strengthen the military capability in defence of the sovereignty of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  For the DPRK to build up its military power is a just step to defend the sovereignty and security of the country under the present tense situation of the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The more frantically the U.S. imperialists intensify their moves to stifle the DPRK, the more firmly the Korean people will consolidate their self-reliant defence power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
