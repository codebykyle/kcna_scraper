This action was taken by Germany not to repeat those crimes as part of the moves to settle its past crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuite contrary to Germany's behavior, Japan has neither admitted nor apologized, nor paid for the past crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists during its invasion of Korea, nor showed any intention to do so for more than six decades since the end of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese reactionaries, however, are becoming so brazen-faced as to distort and justify the crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past, kicking up a whirlwind of militarism throughout the society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a legal and moral obligation and a historical task of Japan to redeem its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is craftily behaving with the calculation that the flow of time would make its past crimes fade away from the minds of the people and they would be no longer a subject of discussion in the end. This is a serious miscalculation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf Japan tries to keep its past crimes buried into oblivion by going without redressing them, this would only add to its crimes and invite more serious punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo matter how much water may flow under the bridge, the Korean people will never forget the Japanese imperialists' history of criminal aggression of Korea but force Japan to pay for it without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times towards settling past crimes and opt for redeeming its past wrongs as soon as possible."

This means providing a sure guarantee for independently solving the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation free from any foreign interference.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is of great historical importance for the north and the south to have decided to closely cooperate with each other in their efforts to put end to their military and hostile relations and ease tension and ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula and to settle all issues arising in improving the inter-Korean relations and achieving the reunification of the country through dialogues and negotiations. This also indicates a basic way of peacefully achieving national reunification free from any struggle between compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the declarations the north and the south also decided to definitely turn the inter-Korean relations into those of mutual respect and trust irrespective of ideology and system and settle the issues of inter-Korean relations in conformity with reconciliation, cooperation and reunification.
