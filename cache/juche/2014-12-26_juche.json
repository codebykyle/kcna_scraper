This is just the revolutionary soldier spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Terming the vegetable greenhouses of the June 8 Farm a standard and model one, he called for conducting a vigorous drive to supply fresh vegetable to the people in all seasons by making the example of the KPA spread across the country like wildfire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Hyon Yong Chol, Pak Yong Sik, Han Kwang Sang and Ri Jae Il."
