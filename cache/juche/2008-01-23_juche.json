            "content": "250-mile Journey for Revolution Linked with Road to National Liberation and Prosperity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- Today is the significant day when President Kim Il Sung set out on the 250-mile Journey for National Liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After his graduation from Badaogou Primary School in Northeast China, he made the 250-mile Journey for Learning true to the lofty intention of his father that a man who was born in Korea should have a good knowledge of Korea. After arriving at Mangyongdae, he attended Changdok School, cultivating a great ambition for national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He received in January Juche 14 (1925) a few months ahead of his graduation the heart-rending news that his father had been arrested again by the Japanese police. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a determination to wage a life and death struggle for taking revenge on the enemy for his father, his family and the Korean nation, he set out on the 250-mile Journey for National Liberation on January 22 regardless of intense cold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went to Kaechon via Sinanju from Pyongyang by train. From there, he walked all along in the teeth of biting cold and blizzard in the northern area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On February 3, the 13th day after he left Mangyongdae, he arrived at Phophyong Ferry and he looked over the motherland and then the alien land across the river with sorrow and indignation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He walked slowly towards the opposite side of the river singing quietly the Song of the River Amnok composed by someone and made a firm resolve not to return to Korea before he won her independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arduous 250-mile journey for revolution covered by the President with a pledge to save the nation from quagmire at the age of 13 led to the liberation of the country and the happiness of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President, true to his great pledge made in the 1920s, waged the 20-year-long bloody anti-Japanese war to accomplish the historical cause of national liberation and humbled the arrogance of the U.S. imperialists in the three-year-long Fatherland Liberation War to defend the nation's sovereignty in the 1950s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also constructed the DPRK that the U.S. imperialists said would not be recovered even in 100 years to be a powerful socialist country independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in defence and laid a solid foundation for eternal prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people bear deep in their mind the philosophy left by the history of the Korean revolution that the long arduous march is linked with the eternal happiness, the philosophy they learned from the 250-mile journey for revolution made by the President.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Bolton's Anti-DPRK Remarks under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the UN, in his article contributed to the \"Wall Street Journal\" let loose a spate of reckless remarks. He claimed that the U.S. should pull out of the dealing with north Korea and opt for a high-handed policy as the presentation of its report on nuclear declaration is delayed. He also blustered that the U.S. should plug south Korea into the PSI and build a triangular cooperation mechanism involving the U.S., Japan and south Korea to pressurize north Korea and it should not be de-listed as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Tuesday in a signed commentary assailing his utterances observes that it cannot but disclose Bolton�fs wicked intention to torpedo the process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as some problems that cropped up at the second phase for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are concerned, they surfaced because the countries participating in the six-party talks failed to keep pace with the measures taken by the DPRK to implement the agreement and the speed at which it has pushed ahead with them in all respects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The process for the denuclearization of the peninsula is under special circumstances as it can make progress only when the six parties honestly fulfill their commitments on the principle of \"action for action.\" Herein lies the reason why the DPRK asserts that the observance of the principle of simultaneous action is vital to advancing the above-said process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. committed itself to cross the DPRK off the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" and stop the application of the \"Trading with the Enemy Act\" against it until the end of last year according to the Oct. 3 agreement adopted at the six-way talks but the U.S. has been hesitating to do so. It is quite self-evident that the DPRK cannot unilaterally implement its commitments under this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly willing to advance the process for the denuclearization of the peninsula, it should simply honor its commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The call made by U.S. conservative hardliners for building the above-mentioned mechanism, misinterpreting the truth about the situation, cannot be construed otherwise than an artifice to achieve their sinister aim.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is something noteworthy that those mandarins took the lead in spreading such technology though they were apt to accuse other countries of \"nuclear proliferation.\" The disclosure of their clandestine dealing in nuclear technology has put this self-styled \"nuclear judge\" in a very embarrassing position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK smear campaign launched by the U.S. is as foolish an act as dropping an axe on its own foot. It would be well advised to stop it and honestly admit to its crimes before the world community, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
