By doing so he enabled the service personnel and people to confidently advance along the road of Songun with a more powerful political weapon for putting spurs to the building of a rich and powerful country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il unrolled a far-reaching plan for building a thriving socialist nation despite a rigorous trial the DPRK had to weather while waging the struggle to defend socialism, powerfully arousing the whole party and army and all the people to the drive for building powerful state and economic potential commensurate with a political and military power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il set the grandiose goal to open the gate to a great prosperous and powerful nation in 2012, the centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung, thereby encouraging the service personnel and people in their efforts to effect a new great revolutionary surge on all fronts of socialist construction by inheriting the tradition of the great Chollima upswing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was an event of special mention as it helped put the cause of building a thriving nation on a higher stage and bring about a historic turning point in the development of the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter underlined the need for the people to bring about a decisive turn in the improvement of the people's standard of living, build a thriving socialist nation as early as possible and bring earlier the final victory of the cause of national reunification and the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Steadfast is the stand of the DPRK to improve the inter-Korean relations and pave the way for national reunification on the basis of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, the reporter noted, calling for improving the inter-Korean relations, promoting national reconciliation and cooperation and waging a dynamic struggle to achieve the unity of the whole nation to bring earlier the day of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to put an end to the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. through dialogue and negotiations, develop the good neighborly and friendly relations with other countries under the banner of independence, peace and friendship and work hard to realize global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only victory and glory are in store for Kim Il Sung's nation led by Kim Jong Il, great man born in Mt. Paektu, who has performed undying exploits that will shine long in the history of the country by leading the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean revolution for the last several decades, bringing earlier a rosy future to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Similar events took place in various provinces, cities and counties of the DPRK."
