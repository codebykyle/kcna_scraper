They have since kicked up a nuclear racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The truth about the monstrous crime planned by the U.S. has been brought to light by secret documents worked out by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A \"top-secret diplomatic document\" drafted by the U.S. State Department said the U.S. discussed the plan for using A-bombs on six occasions during the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During his inspection of the Korean front in December 1952, Eisenhower openly hinted at the use of nuclear weapons and even prepared \"Eisenhower offensive\" envisaging the mobilization of weapons of mass destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korean war-related documents declassified by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and confidential documents discovered at the U.S. national archives show that the U.S. nuclear weapon was first deployed in south Korea in mid-August 1950 and in November the same year the then U.S. President Truman talked to reporters that the use of A-bomb is under constant examination. MacArthur was also proved to have said that there was a plan to drop 30-50 A-bombs in Korea-China border.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are also records that U.S. air force's B-29s held A-bomb dropping exercises in the sky above Pyongyang in September and October 1951 and that the U.S. air force made reports from May to July 1953 on the progress made in the A-bomb plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was written in a diary of the then U.S. air force commander in Far East that the operational study room of the U.S. Department of Army analyzed in detail the issue of tactically using A-bomb in the close ground support operations from September 1950. There are also data showing that the U.S. made detailed examination of the use of nuclear weapons in the Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There revealed in succession documents and data exposing the U.S. persistent provocations for a nuclear war even after the end of the Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Top-secret operational plan 8-53 laid out by the U.S. Strategic Air Command right after the armistice envisaged the massive drop of nuclear bombs in Korea and China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When EC-121 large spy plane incident broke out, the U.S. worked out emergency nuclear attack plan in June 1969. The plan envisaged attacks on airfields and naval bases of the DPRK with 0.2-70 kt nuclear weapons and, furthermore, rendering the most of its military capacity ineffective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The confidential document of the U.S. Pacific Command that was declassified in 2006 also clarified that the U.S. moved to use nuclear weapons against the DPRK in 1975.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A U.S. military confidential document drafted on December 9, 1998 also clarified that the U.S. air force planes deployed in a military base in North Carolina State of the U.S. staged exercises simulating nuclear attacks on the targets of the DPRK several times from January to June that year. It was said that biological and chemical weapons attack operation was also included in the exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another U.S. military confidential document--support team for weaponry for south Korea-standard procedures for nuclear operations in south Korea-- which was declassified in December 2010 proved that nuclear weapons had been in deployment in a U.S. military base in Chunchon till April 2005.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to a data clarified by a U.S. organization when demanding the U.S. Pacific Command open to public information, 3 million depleted uranium bombs are stockpiled in the U.S. air force military bases in Suwon, Osan, Chongju and other areas of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The depleted uranium bombs with massive destruction power have been used without hesitation in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces fired depleted uranium shells and dropped depleted uranium bombs 60 hours per week in the firing ground that existed in Maehyang-ri, Kyonggi Province, leaving a lot of people dead or wounded and destroying hundreds of houses. Even after the closure of the firing ground, inhabitants in this area are suffering from all kinds of diseases including radioactive contamination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuclear Posture Review worked out by the U.S. in January 2002 shocked people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A secret report submitted to Congress by the U.S. Defense Department said that the U.S. can preempt a nuclear attack on seven countries including the DPRK even though those countries do not have nuclear weapons and the U.S. is not directly attacked by nuclear weapons. The document stressed the need to develop and use new smaller nukes capable of destroying underground bunkers and work out a research plan and resume nuclear test.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report also contained the fact that formations of F-16 fighter bombers belonging to the U.S. 8th combat air division stationed in the U.S. air force base in Kunsan, south Korea received the training of attacking the DPRK with B-61 nuclear bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean and other world media denounced the report, saying that \"it is shuddering\" and \"the danger of a nuclear war is becoming a reality\". The report disclosed the U.S. true nature as a nuclear fanatic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that the U.S. has worked hard to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK after making the nuclear war a fait accompli from long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists are matchless beasts and nuclear criminal who would not hesitate to inflict nuclear disaster on humankind and exterminate other nation to meet their ambition for aggression and realize their strategy for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. warmongers prodded the south Korean puppet regime, its colonial stooge, to hold reckless DPRK-targeted nuclear war exercises such as Ulji Freedom Guardian, increasing the danger of nuclear holocaust in the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuke should be answered with nuke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation proves that there is no other choice for the DPRK but to bolster nuclear deterrent for self-defense to safeguard its sovereignty and dignity."

Korea's Moves to Turn Int'l Conference into Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights\" Theater under Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet regime is set to turn the International Pen Conference due in south Korea in mid-September into the theater of anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket. In this regard a spokesman for the Central Committee of the Writers Union of Korea gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA on Saturday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors is working hard to intensify the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket with the Conference as a momentum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime openly says that it \"plans to project the north's human rights issue\", while trying to draw the \"Pen Center of Defectors from the North\" consisting of human scum into the International Pen Club. It also moves to present such sinister anti-DPRK burlesque as \"work\" and \"performance\" by instigating them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the south Korean authorities and the candidate to \"presidency\" from the \"Saenuri Party\" are moving to join them to fan up the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an intolerable insult to the sacred writing activities based on justice, conscience and truth and revelation of the sordid intention to escalate confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the Writers Union of Korea bitterly denounces the above-said plot of the Lee regime as an unethical crime against reunification that tramples down on human civilization and intellectuality and escalates confrontation between the north and the south of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature, the Lee regime has no face to talk about human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans are deprived of elementary freedom and rights as human being\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea has turned into the biggest graveyard of human rights by unpopular rule and harsh suppression of the media and writing activities by the puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans' grievances are sky-high and the puppet regime is fated to its end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for such guys who are more dead than alive to try to turn the conference into a theater for kicking up anti-DPRK smear campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Conference should never be a plaything of the puppet regime which is hell-bent on confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should pay due attention to the harsh suppression of the media and the grim human rights situation in south Korea where freedom of speech is wantonly violated and elementary human rights are abused.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Conference turns away from these issues and is misused for meeting the Lee regime's sinister intention for confrontation, this will be little different from undermining the idea and image of the International Pen Club aspiring after the worldwide writers community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans including the conscientious writers in the north, south and abroad should never allow the Lee group to turn the international conference into the theater of confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK expects that the fair public and intellectuals of the world would extend support to the Koreans in their efforts for reconciliation, unity and reunification against the anti-DPRK smear campaign by the south Korean conservative regime."

(acuerdos alcanzados el 13 de febrero y el 3 de octubre de 2007 en las conversaciones a 6 bandas)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero esta platica no se reanuda todavia por 4 anos despues de su ultima ronda en diciembre de 2008 y en ese periodo, EE.UU. elevo el grado de hostilidad a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa primera medida tomada por la administracion Obama sobre Corea fue cuestionar de manera discriminada el lanzamiento del satelite artificial con fines pacificos \"Kwangmyongsong-2\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa extremada politica hostil encaminada a privar a la RPDC del derecho soberano al uso pacifico del cosmos, reconocido por el derecho internacional, produjo la reaccion para la autodefensa de prueba nuclear, lo cual desato el circulo vicioso de desconfianza y enfrentamiento como la sancion contra la RPDC y el inicio de la construccion por cuenta propia de la central de reactores de agua ligera y la aceleracion de produccion de uranio enriquecido como combustible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra que si no se elimina totalmente la arraigada concepcion hostil a la RPDC de EE.UU., no se puede resolver ningun problema y al contrario, aumentara solo el peligro de enfrentamiento y conflicto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl principio del dialogo RPDC-EE.UU. la primera insistio en que si EE.UU. renuncia primero su politica hostil, sera posible la solucion del problema nuclear mientras el segundo abogo por que la primera renuncie primero las armas nucleares para normalizar las relaciones bilaterales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese curso, gracias a la sinceridad y magnanimidad de la RPDC, se presento el principio de accion simultanea: \"palabra por palabra\" y \"accion por accion\", el cual devino la base del dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, 20 anos de las conversaciones RPDC-EE.UU. ensenan que el principio de accion simultanea no puede ser efectivo si no se elimina primero la concepcion hostil de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC."
