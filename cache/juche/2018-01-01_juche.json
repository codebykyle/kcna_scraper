            "content": "Kim Jong Un Makes New Year Address\r\nPyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un made the New Year Address for 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe full text of the New Year Address reads:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDear fellow countrymen and brave service personnel of the People's Army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDear compatriots, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToday, recollecting with great pleasure and pride and deep emotion the proud achievements we performed last year through our diligent and worthwhile labour and sincere efforts and by the sweat of our brow, we are all seeing in the new year 2018 with fresh hopes and expectations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGreeting the hope-filled new year, I wish the families across the country good health, happiness, success and prosperity. I also wish that the beautiful dreams of all our people, including the hopes of our children in the new year, would come true. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs I look back upon last year, when I worked strenuously on the road of achieving national prosperity, gaining great strength and wisdom from the pure minds of the dauntless people who invariably trusted and followed the Party even in the face of manifold difficulties and trials, I feel my heart swelling with the pride in waging the revolution shoulder to shoulder with a great people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I extend sincere thanks and New Year greetings to all the people and service personnel who won miraculous victories to be noteworthy in the national history of 5 000 years by sharing mind and purpose with the Party and supporting its determination on the road of arduous yet glorious struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMy New Year greetings go also to the compatriots in the south and abroad who are fighting for the reunification of the country and to the progressive peoples and other friends across the world who opposed war of aggression and gave firm solidarity to our cause of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe year 2017 was a year of heroic struggle and great victory, a year when we set up an indestructible milestone in the history of building a powerful socialist country with the spirit of self-reliance and self-development as the dynamic force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year the moves of the United States and its vassal forces to isolate and stifle our country went to extremes, and our revolution faced the harshest-ever challenges. In the face of the prevailing situation and the worst trials on the road of advance, our Party trusted the people and the people defended the Party death-defyingly, turning adversity and misfortune to good account and achieving brilliant successes on all the fronts where a powerful socialist country is being built.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThrough last year's grandiose struggle we powerfully demonstrated at home and abroad our immutable faith and will to follow to the end the road of Juche-oriented socialism opened up by the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and the single-hearted unity of socialist Korea in which all the people are firmly united behind the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn outstanding success our Party, state and people won last year was the accomplishment of the great, historic cause of perfecting the national nuclear forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn this platform one year ago I officially made public on behalf of the Party and government that we had entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. In the past one year we conducted several rounds of its test launch, aimed at implementing the programme, safely and transparently, thus proving before the eyes of the world its definite success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy also conducting tests of various means of nuclear delivery and super-intense thermonuclear weapon, we attained our general orientation and strategic goal with success, and our Republic has at last come to possess a powerful and reliable war deterrent, which no force and nothing can reverse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur country's nuclear forces are capable of thwarting and countering any nuclear threats from the United States, and they constitute a powerful deterrent that prevents it from starting an adventurous war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn no way would the United States dare to ignite a war against me and our country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe whole of its mainland is within the range of our nuclear strike and the nuclear button is on my office desk all the time; the United States needs to be clearly aware that this is not merely a threat but a reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe have realized the wish of the great leaders who devoted their lives to building the strongest national defence capability for reliably safeguarding our country's sovereignty, and we have created a mighty sword for defending peace, as desired by all our people who had to tighten their belts for long years. This great victory eloquently proves the validity and vitality of the Party's line of simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces and its idea of prioritizing science, and it is a great historic achievement that has opened up bright prospects for the building of a prosperous country and inspired our service personnel and people with confidence in sure victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI offer my noble respects to the heroic Korean people who, despite the difficult living conditions caused by life-threatening sanctions and blockade, have firmly trusted, absolutely supported and dynamically implemented our Party's line of simultaneously promoting the two fronts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMy warm, comradely greetings go also to our defence scientists and workers in the munitions industry who made devoted efforts all the year round, to demonstrate to the world that the plans and decisions of the Party Central Committee are a science and a truth and that they automatically mean their materialization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year we also made notable headway in carrying out the five-year strategy for national economic development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a result of our vigorous endeavour to establish the Juche orientation in the metallurgical industry, an oxygen-blast furnace of our own style was built at the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex to maintain regular production of pig iron by relying on anthracite, and prospects were opened up for consolidating the independent foundations of the chemical industry and attaining the five-year strategy's goal for the output of chemical products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNumerous light-industry factories in such sectors as textile, footwear, knitwear and foodstuff industries raised high the banner of Juche orientation and made proactive efforts to propel the modernization of several production lines by means of our own technology and our own equipment. By doing so, they provided a guarantee for making the range of consumer goods varied and improving their quality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe machine-building industry, by upholding the banner of self-reliance and relying on science and technology, creditably attained the Party's goal for the production of new-type tractors and trucks, and thus laid solid foundations for speeding up the Juche orientation and modernization of the national economy and the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy. The agricultural sector, by actively introducing scientific farming methods, increased the ranks of high-yield farms and workteams and reaped an unusually rich fruit harvest in spite of unfavourable climatic conditions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur service personnel and people built magnificent Ryomyong Street and the large-scale livestock farming base in the Sepho area, and completed the task for the first stage of the forest restoration campaign, thereby demonstrating the might of great army-people unity and the potential of the socialist independent economy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmid a vigorous struggle for the creation of the Mallima speed, new model units emerged one after another, and a large number of factories and enterprises fulfilled their quotas of the yearly national economic plan ahead of schedule and made a proud achievement of surpassing their peak-year levels. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuccesses were also made on the scientific and cultural fronts last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tScientists and technicians resolved scientific and technological problems arising in the building of a powerful socialist country and completed research projects in the cutting-edge field, thereby giving stimulus to economic development and the improvement of the people's living standards. The socialist education system was further improved and the educational environment upgraded, while medical service conditions were bettered. An example of artistic performance activities was created to infuse the whole country with revolutionary optimism and the militant spirit, and our sportspeople won victories in different international competitions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the successes made last year are the triumph of the Juche-oriented revolutionary line of the Workers' Party of Korea and a precious fruition of the heroic struggle of the service personnel and people who are firmly rallied behind the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur Party and people achieved such signal victories others could never think of achieving by their own efforts in the face of the sanctions-and-blockade moves the United States and its vassal forces perpetrated more viciously than ever before to stamp out the rights to sovereignty, existence and development of the DPRK. Herein lies the source of their dignity and their great pride and self-confidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI would like to extend my warm thanks once again to all the people and service personnel who victoriously advanced the cause of building a powerful socialist country, always sharing the destiny with the Party and braving all difficulties and trials on the eventful days of last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis year we will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Democratic People's Republic of Korea. To mark the 70th anniversary of their state with splendour is of real significance for the great people, who have raised with dignity the status of their socialist country, the greatest patriotic legacy of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il, to that of a strategic state recognized by the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should make constant innovations and continued progress until we win the final victory of the revolution by carrying on the tradition of heroic struggle and collective innovation which adorned the founding and course of development of Juche Korea. A revolutionary general offensive should be launched to achieve fresh victory on all fronts of building a powerful socialist country by taking the historic victory in the building of the DPRK's nuclear forces as a springboard for fresh progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Let us launch a revolutionary general offensive to achieve fresh victory on all fronts of building a powerful socialist country!\"?this is the revolutionary slogan we should uphold. All officials, Party members and other working people should launch an all-people general offensive to frustrate the challenges of the hostile forces who are making last-ditch efforts and raise the overall strength of our Republic to a new stage of development as they brought about a great upsurge in socialist construction overcoming all difficulties through the great Chollima upswing after the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA breakthrough should be made in reenergizing the overall economic front this year, the third year of implementing the five-year strategy for national economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe central task facing socialist economic construction this year is to enhance the independence and Juche character of the national economy and improve the people's standard of living as required by the revolutionary counterstrategy put forward by the Second Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should concentrate all efforts on consolidating the independence and Juche character of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe electric-power industry should maintain and reinforce the self-supporting power generation bases, and direct a great deal of efforts to developing new power sources. A dynamic campaign should be conducted to drastically increase thermal power generation, and lower the loss of electric power and increase its production as much as possible by maintaining and reinforcing imperfect generating facilitates. Provinces should build power generation bases to suit their local features and put power generation at the existing medium and small-sized power stations on a normal footing to satisfy the needs of electric power for local industry by themselves. Alternated production should be organized scrupulously throughout the country, and a vigorous struggle waged against the practices of wasting electric power to make effective use of generated electric power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe metallurgical industry should further improve the Juche-oriented iron- and steel-making technologies, increase the iron production capacity and drastically raise the quality of metallic materials in order to satisfy the needs of the national economy for iron and steel. It is necessary to ensure a preferential, planned and timely supply of electricity, concentrated iron ore, anthracite, lignite, freight wagons, locomotives and funds for the metallurgical industry. By doing so, we can fulfil next year's iron and steel production plans and make the industry Juche-oriented without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe chemical industry should step up the establishment of the C1 chemical industry, push the projects for catalyst production base and phosphatic fertilizer factory as scheduled, and renovate and perfect the sodium carbonate production line whose starting material is glauberite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe machine-building industry should modernize the Kumsong Tractor Factory, Sungni Motor Complex and other factories to develop and produce world-level machinery in our style. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe coal and mineral production and rail transport sectors should make concerted efforts to make the country's self-reliant economic foundations prove their effectiveness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNotably, the rail transport sector should make the best use of the existing transport capacity by making transport organization and control more scientific and rational, and maintain discipline and order in the railways as rigid as in the army, so as to ensure an accident-free, on-schedule rail traffic. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA turn should be brought about this year in improving the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLight-industry factories need to transform their equipment and production lines into labour- and electricity-saving ones and produce and supply more diversified and quality consumer goods with domestic raw and other materials, and provinces, cities and counties should develop the local economy in a characteristic way by relying on their own raw material resources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe agricultural and fishing fronts should effect an upswing. We should introduce seeds of superior strains, high-yield farming methods and high-performance farm machines on an extensive scale, do farming scientifically and technologically so as to fulfil the cereals production plan without fail, and boost the production of livestock products, fruits, greenhouse vegetables and mushrooms. We should enhance our ship building and repair capacities, launch scientific fishing campaigns, and reenergize aquatic farming.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis year the service personnel and people should join efforts to complete the construction of the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area in the shortest period of time, push ahead with major construction projects including the renovation of Samjiyon County, the construction of the Tanchon Power Station and the second-stage waterway project of South Hwanghae Province, and channel steady efforts into the construction of houses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBuilding on the success we achieved in the forest restoration campaign, we should properly protect and manage the forests that have already been created, improve the technical conditions of roads, conduct river improvement on a regular basis, and protect environment in a scientific and responsible manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvery sector and every unit of the national economy should enlist their own technical forces and economic potential to the maximum and launch a dynamic struggle to increase production and practise economy, so as to create a greater amount of material wealth. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA shortcut to developing the self-sufficient economy is to give precedence to science and technology and make innovations in economic planning and guidance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe scientific research sector should solve on a preferential basis the scientific and technological problems arising in establishing Juche-oriented production lines of our own style, ensuring domestic production of raw and other materials and equipment, and perfecting the structure of the self-supporting economy. Every sector and every unit of the national economy should make a contribution to achieving production growth by intensifying the dissemination of science and technology and waging a brisk technological innovation drive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Cabinet and other economic guidance organs should work out a realistic operational plan to carry out the national economic plan for this year and push forward the work for its implementation responsibly and persistently. Positive measures should be taken by the state to ensure that the socialist system of responsible business operation proves its worth in factories, enterprises and cooperative organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSocialist culture should be developed in a comprehensive way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is necessary to strengthen the ranks of teachers, improve the contents and methods of education as demanded by the trend of developing modern education, apply the people-oriented character in public health service in a thoroughgoing way, and boost the production of medical equipment and appliances and different kinds of medicines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should conduct mass-based sporting activities briskly, create sporting techniques and tactics of our own style, and produce artistic and literary masterpieces which truthfully depict the heroic struggle and life of our service personnel and people in the Mallima era and the beautiful and sublime features proper to human beings. In this way, we can crush the bourgeois reactionary culture by dint of our revolutionary socialist art and literature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA vigorous struggle should be waged to tighten moral discipline throughout society, establish a socialist way of life and eliminate all kinds of non-socialist practices, so as to ensure that all the people, possessed of ennobling mental and moral traits, lead a revolutionary and cultured life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe self-reliant defence capability should be further consolidated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this year of the 70th anniversary of the development of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army into a regular revolutionary armed force by the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, the People's Army should perfect its features as befits the revolutionary armed forces of the Party. It should organize and conduct combat training in a highly intensive way, in a real-war atmosphere, to develop all its units in different arms, services and corps into the ranks of a-match-for-a-hundred combatants. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean People's Internal Security Forces should sharpen the edge of the sword of the class struggle and detect and frustrate the schemes by undesirable and hostile elements in time. The Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards should enhance their combat capability in all aspects through intensive combat and political training.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy consistently holding fast to the line of simultaneously promoting the two fronts in accordance with the strategic policy set by the Party at the Eighth Conference of Munitions Industry, the defence industry should develop and manufacture powerful strategic weapons and military hardware of our style, perfect its Juche-oriented production structure and modernize its production lines on the basis of cutting-edge science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe nuclear weapons research sector and the rocket industry should mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles, the power and reliability of which have already been proved to the full, to give a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we should always be ready for immediate nuclear counterattack to cope with the enemy's manoeuvres for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe political and ideological might is the first and foremost strength of our state and the great propellant for opening up an avenue for building a powerful socialist country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to successfully carry out the fighting tasks facing us, we should rally the whole Party more firmly on its organizational and ideological basis and establish a thoroughgoing revolutionary climate within the Party. In this way, we can constantly enhance its fighting efficiency and leadership role in the overall revolution and construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll Party organizations should never tolerate all shades of heterogeneous ideas and double standards of discipline that run counter to the Party's ideology, but strengthen the single-hearted unity of the whole Party centred on its Central Committee in every way possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe whole Party should launch an intense struggle to establish a revolutionary climate within the Party with the main emphasis put on rooting out the abuse of Party authority, bureaucratism and other outdated methods and style of work, so as to ensure that the ties of kinship between the Party and the masses of the people are as solid as a rock. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParty organizations should intensify Party guidance to ensure that the work of their respective sectors and units is always conducted in conformity with the ideas and intentions of the Party and the requirements of its policies, and find satisfactory solutions to the problems arising in the building of a powerful socialist country by giving definite precedence to political work and motivating the people ideologically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should rally all the service personnel and people firmly behind the Party ideologically and volitionally so that they throw in their lot with it whatever the adversity and fight with devotion for the victory of the socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParty and working people's organizations and government organs should orient and subordinate all their undertakings to strengthening the single-hearted unity. The benchmark in planning and launching their work should be the people's demands and interests. And they should go deep among the people, sharing good times and bad with them and solving their mental agony and difficulties in their lives. They should ensure that the shorter the supply of everything is, the fuller play is given to the beautiful traits of comrades and neighbours helping and caring for one another with all sincerity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should give free rein to the indomitable mental strength of the heroic Korean people on the present grand Mallima march.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParty and working people's organizations should ensure that all the working people cherish patriotism in their hearts and bring about collective innovations one after another in the great campaign to create the Mallima speed with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and science and technology as the dynamic force. They should see to it that officials, Party members and other working people carry forward the fighting spirit displayed by the elder generations who brought about epochal changes on the grand Chollima march and all of them become Mallima pioneers who vigorously rush forward in the vanguard of the era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year, too, our people made strenuous efforts to defend the peace of the country and hasten national reunification in keeping with the aspirations and demands of the nation. However, owing to the vicious sanctions and pressure by the United States and its vassal forces and their desperate manoeuvres to ignite a war, all aimed at checking the reinforcement of the self-defensive nuclear deterrent by our Republic, the situation on the Korean peninsula became aggravated as never before, and greater difficulties and obstacles were put on the road of the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven though the conservative \"regime\" in south Korea, which had resorted to fascist rule and confrontation with fellow countrymen, collapsed and the ruling circles were replaced by another thanks to the massive resistance by the enraged people of all walks of life, nothing has been changed in the relations between the north and the south. On the contrary, the south Korean authorities, siding with the United States in its hostile policy towards the DPRK against the aspirations of all the fellow countrymen for national reunification, drove the situation to a tight corner, further aggravated the mistrust and confrontation between the north and the south, and brought the bilateral relations to a fix that can be hardly resolved. We can never escape the holocaust of a nuclear war forced by the outside forces, let alone achieve national reunification, unless we put an end to this abnormal situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe prevailing situation demands that now the north and the south improve the relations between themselves and take decisive measures for achieving a breakthrough for independent reunification without being obsessed by bygone days. No one can present an honourable appearance in front of the nation if he or she ignores the urgent demands of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis year is significant both for the north and the south as in the north the people will greet the 70th founding anniversary of their Republic as a great, auspicious event and in the south the Winter Olympic Games will take place. In order to not only celebrate these great national events in a splendid manner but also demonstrate the dignity and spirit of the nation at home and abroad, we should improve the frozen inter-Korean relations and glorify this meaningful year as an eventful one noteworthy in the history of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst of all, we should work together to ease the acute military tension between the north and the south and create a peaceful environment on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as this unstable situation, which is neither wartime nor peacetime, persists, the north and the south cannot ensure the success of the scheduled events, nor can they sit face to face to have a sincere discussion over the issue of improving bilateral relations, nor will they advance straight ahead towards the goal of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north and the south should desist from doing anything that might aggravate the situation, and they should make concerted efforts to defuse military tension and create a peaceful environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities should respond positively to our sincere efforts for a detente, instead of inducing the exacerbation of the situation by joining the United States in its reckless moves for a north-targeted nuclear war that threatens the destiny of the entire nation as well as peace and stability on this land. They should discontinue all the nuclear war drills they stage with outside forces, as these drills will engulf this land in flames and lead to bloodshed on our sacred territory. They should also refrain from any acts of bringing in nuclear armaments and aggressive forces from the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven though the United States is wielding the nuclear stick and going wild for another war, it will not dare to invade us because we currently have a powerful nuclear deterrent. And when the north and the south are determined, they can surely prevent the outbreak of war and ease tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA climate favourable for national reconciliation and reunification should be established.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe improvement of inter-Korean relations is a pressing matter of concern not only to the authorities but to all other Koreans, and it is a crucial task to be carried out through a concerted effort by the entire nation. The north and the south should promote bilateral contact, travel, cooperation and exchange on a broad scale to remove mutual misunderstanding and distrust, and fulfil their responsibility and role as the motive force of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will open our doors to anyone from south Korea, including the ruling party and opposition parties, organizations and individual personages of all backgrounds, for dialogue, contact and travel, if they sincerely wish national concord and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA definite end should be put to the acts that might offend the other party and incite discord and hostility between fellow countrymen. The south Korean authorities should not try, as the previous conservative \"regime\" did, to block contact and travel by people of different social strata and suppress the atmosphere for reunification through alliance with the north, under absurd pretexts and by invoking legal and institutional mechanisms; instead, they should direct efforts to creating conditions and environment conducive to national concord and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo improve inter-Korean relations as soon as possible, the authorities of the north and the south should raise the banner of national independence higher than ever before, and fulfil their responsibility and role they have assumed for the times and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInter-Korean relations are, to all intents and purposes, an internal matter of our nation, which the north and the south should resolve on their own responsibility. Therefore, they should acquire a steadfast stand and viewpoint that they will resolve all the issues arising in bilateral relations on the principle of By Our Nation Itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities need to know that they will gain nothing from touring foreign countries to solicit their help on the issue of inter-Korean relations, and that such behaviour will give the outside forces, who pursue dishonest objectives, an excuse for their interference and complicate matters further. Now it is not time for the north and the south to turn their backs on each other and merely express their respective standpoints; it is time that they sit face to face with a view to holding sincere discussions over the issue of improving inter-Korean relations by our nation itself and seek a way out for its settlement in a bold manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for the Winter Olympic Games to be held soon in south Korea, it will serve as a good occasion for demonstrating our nation's prestige and we earnestly wish the Olympic Games a success. From this point of view we are willing to dispatch our delegation and adopt other necessary measures; with regard to this matter, the authorities of the north and the south may meet together soon. Since we are compatriots of the same blood as south Koreans, it is natural for us to share their pleasure over the auspicious event and help them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will, in the future, too, resolve all issues by the efforts of our nation itself under the unfurled banner of national independence and frustrate the schemes by anti-reunification forces within and without on the strength of national unity, thereby opening up a new history of national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAvailing myself of this opportunity, I extend warm New Year greetings once again to all Korean compatriots at home and abroad, and I sincerely wish that in this significant year everything would go well both in the north and in the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe international situation we witnessed last year was clear proof that our Party and our state were absolutely correct in their strategic judgement and decision that when we are confronting the imperialist forces of aggression who are attempting to wreck global peace and security and make mankind suffer a nuclear holocaust, our only recourse is the power of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a responsible, peace-loving nuclear power, our country will neither have recourse to nuclear weapons unless hostile forces of aggression violate its sovereignty and interests nor threaten any other country or region by means of nuclear weapons. However, it will resolutely respond to acts of wrecking peace and security on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur Party and the government of our Republic will develop good-neighbourly and friendly relations with all the countries that respect our national sovereignty and are friendly to us, and make positive efforts to build a just and peaceful new world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe year 2018 will be recorded as another year of victory for our people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt this moment when this year's gigantic march has begun, I am filled with confidence that our cause is ever-victorious as it is supported by the people, and I harden my resolve to make devoted efforts to live up to their expectations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Republic will never cease to struggle and advance until achieving the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche by relying on the trust and strength of the people, but surely hasten the future of a powerful socialist country where all the people lead a dignified and happy life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us all march forward dynamically towards fresh victory of the revolution by displaying the unyielding mettle of heroic Korea under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea."

En medio de la situacion creada y las durisimas pruebas que impedian nuestro avance, el Partido confio en el pueblo y este defendio resueltamente a aquel, trocando la adversidad en circunstancia favorable y la desgracia en suerte y logrando exitos deslumbrantes en todos los dominios de la construccion de la potencia socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa magna lucha del ano pasado puso de manifiesto ante el mundo nuestra inquebrantable voluntad y fe de seguir hasta el fin por el camino del socialismo jucheano establecido por el gran Lider Kim Il Sung y el gran General Kim Jong Il, y la unidad monolitica de la Corea socialista en que todo el pueblo se ha aglomerado en torno al Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl exito mas relevante de nuestro Partido, Estado y pueblo en el ano pasado es el logro de la gran causa historica del perfeccionamiento de las fuerzas armadas nucleares del Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExactamente un ano antes, aqui anuncie en nombre del Partido y gobierno que los preparativos del ensayo del cohete balistico intercontinental se impulsaban en su fase final. Varias pruebas llevadas a cabo con seguridad y transparencia a lo largo de un ano comprobaron ante el mundo la certeza de su exito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado tambien ensayamos armas termonucleares superpotentes, ademas de gran variedad de medios de transporte de artefactos nucleares, con lo cual alcanzamos con todo exito nuestras metas estrategicas de acuerdo a nuestra orientacion general y nuestra Republica llego a poseer finalmente un potente y fiable disuasivo de guerra, irreversible con ninguna fuerza o medio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas armadas nucleares de nuestro Estado pueden neutralizar y responder a cualquier amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. y son poderosos disuasivos que lo controlan para que desista del aventurado juego con el fuego. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse pais jamas puede provocar la guerra ni a mi ni a nuestro Estado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el territorio norteamericano esta al alcance de nuestro ataque nuclear y en todo momento esta a mi disposicion el boton nuclear en el escritorio de mi despacho. Esta es una realidad, y jamas una mera amenaza, que deben tener bien claro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHemos hecho realidad el deseo del gran Lider y del gran General quienes consagraron la vida a preparar la mayor capacidad de defensa estatal que permitiera salvaguardar con firmeza la soberania nacional y disponemos de un remedio omnipotente para la paz que anhelabamos durante muchos anos en que  teniamos que apretarnos el cinturon. Esta gran victoria es una prueba tangible de la justeza y vitalidad de la linea de desarrollo paralelo y el aprecio de las ciencias del Partido, asi como un acontecimiento de trascendencia historica que deparo la brillante perspectiva de la construccion de la patria poderosa y que inspiro a nuestros militares y otros sectores del pueblo firme fe en el triunfo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRindo mi mas sincero tributo al heroico pueblo coreano que si bien llevan una vida dura debido a las sanciones y el bloqueo que amenazan su subsistencia, han confiado plenamente, apoyado incondicionalmente y respaldado energicamente la linea de nuestro Partido sobre el desarrollo paralelo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsimismo, extiendo mis fervorosos saludos de companero a nuestros cientificos y obreros del sector de defensa nacional quienes durante todo un ano se consagraron para demostrar ante el mundo que el pensamiento y la decision del Comite Central del Partido son la ciencia, la verdad y la practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado conocio un notable avance tambien en el cumplimiento de la Estrategia Quinquenal para el desarrollo de la economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias al tesonero esfuerzo por adecuar la industria metalurgica a las condiciones del pais, se levanto en el Complejo Siderurgico Kim Chaek un alto horno basado en nuestro propio metodo de calentamiento por el oxigeno que permite normalizar la produccion de arrabio con la antracita, se consolido la base independiente de la industria quimica y se abrio una buena perspectiva para alcanzar la meta de ese sector trazada por la Estrategia Quinquenal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl modernizar con nuestra tecnologia y equipos los procesos de produccion enarbolando la bandera de la autoctonia, numerosas fabricas de industria ligera como las de textil, calzados, tricotas y alimentos lograron incrementar los generos y la variedad de los productos de consumo masivo y asegurar su calidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApoyandose en sus propias fuerzas, las ciencias y la tecnologia, el sector de la industria mecanica alcanzo exitosamente la meta trazada por el Partido de la produccion de tractores y camiones de nuevo tipo y sento una solida base para acelerar la autoctonia, la modernizacion de la economia nacional y la mecanizacion integral de la economia rural. En el sector agricola introdujeron metodos cientificos de cultivo, aumentaron el numero de granjas y brigadas de alto rendimiento pese a las adversas condiciones climaticas y lograron una cosecha de frutas sin parangon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl levantar el magnifico reparto Ryomyong y la gran base ganadera en la zona de Sepho y cumplir las tareas de la reforestacion en su primera fase, pusieron de manifiesto el poderio de la gran unidad ejercito-pueblo y las potencialidades de la economia socialista independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud de las energicas actividades para crear la Velocidad de Mallima (caballo legendario que cubre al dia una distancia de 4 000 kilometros ?N.T.), nuevas unidades ejemplares nacieron una tras otra e innumerables fabricas y empresas se honraron en cumplir con antelacion el plan anual de la economia nacional y batir el record de produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado logramos exitos tambien en los sectores de las ciencias y la cultura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos cientificos y tecnicos resolvieron los problemas cientificos y tecnicos que enfrentaban en la construccion de la potencia socialista y cumplieron las tareas de investigacion de la tecnologia de punta, fomentando el desarrollo economico y el bienestar del pueblo. El sistema de la ensenanza socialista conocio un mayor perfeccionamiento, la atmosfera educacional una mayor renovacion y los servicios medicos una nueva mejoria. Se dieron ejemplos de las actividades artisticas que animaron a todo el pais con el optimismo revolucionario y espiritu combativo, y nuestros deportistas ganaron en varias competencias internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los exitos del ano que despedimos confirman el triunfo de la original linea revolucionaria del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y son preciosos frutos de la heroica gesta del ejercito y pueblo unidos compactamente en torno a esa organizacion politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando recrudecian como nunca antes las sanciones y el bloqueo de Estados Unidos y sus seguidores para privar a nuestra Republica de la soberania y los derechos a la existencia y desarrollo, con nuestras propias fuerzas alcanzamos victorias que otros no se atrevian. He aqui precisamente la dignidad y el gran honor y orgullo de nuestro Partido y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUna vez mas agradezco sinceramente a todos los civiles y militares que en los momentos trascendentales del ano pasado compartieron siempre el mismo destino con el Partido y superaron contratiempos y vicisitudes que encaraban, impulsando victoriosamente la causa de la construccion de una potencia socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano celebramos el 70° aniversario de la fundacion de la gloriosa Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. Resulta realmente significativo que un gran pueblo que haya situado en la digna posicion del Estado estrategico a su pais socialista, maximo legado de los patriotas Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il, conmemore con solemnidad los setenta anos de su Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlevando adelante las tradiciones de la gesta heroica y la innovacion colectiva registradas en la historia de la construccion y el desarrollo de la Corea del Juche, debemos seguir innovando y avanzando hasta alcanzar la victoria final de la revolucion. Tomaremos la victoria historica que logramos en la preparacion de las fuerzas armadas nucleares de la Republica como un trampolin para el nuevo desarrollo y lanzaremos una ofensiva general revolucionaria para alcanzar nuevas victorias en todos los dominios de la construccion de un poderoso Estado socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"!Alcancemos nuevos triunfos en todos los dominios de la construccion de la potencia socialista con una ofensiva general revolucionaria!\", esta es la consigna revolucionaria que debemos enarbolar. A todos los cuadros, militantes partidistas y demas trabajadores les compete lanzar una ofensiva de todo el pueblo, como en la posguerra cuando superaron dificultades con el gran auge de Chollima y dieron grandes saltos en la construccion socialista, para frustrar los retos de las fuerzas hostiles que hacen desesperados esfuerzos y llevar el conjunto del poderio de la Republica a una nueva fase de desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano, el tercero del cumplimiento de la Estrategia Quinquenal para el desarrollo de la economia nacional, debemos comenzar a activar todos los dominios de la economia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tarea fundamental de la construccion de la economia socialista de este ano es destacar el caracter independiente y autoctono de la economia nacional de acuerdo con la exigencia de la estrategia de la respuesta revolucionaria presentada en el II Pleno del VII Periodo del CC del Partido y elevar el nivel de vida de la poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las fuerzas se concentraran en resaltar el caracter independiente y autoctono de la economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector de la industria electrica arreglaran y reforzaran los centros generadores independientes y pondran un gran empeno en la explotacion de nuevos recursos energeticos. Aumentaran decisivamente la generacion termoelectrica, repararan y reforzaran los defectuosos equipos generadores para disminuir la perdida de la electricidad y optimizar su generacion. En las provincias construiran bases de generacion electrica apropiadas  a sus peculiaridades y normalizaran la produccion en las centrales hidroelectricas de mediano y pequeno tamanos para asi asegurar la demanda de las industrias locales. Organizaran con escrupulosidad la produccion alternativa a escala nacional, combatiran energicamente el despilfarro de electricidad y promoveran su eficaz aprovechamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector de la industria metalurgica perfeccionaran la autoctona tecnologia de fundicion de hierro y acero, aumentaran la productividad de hierro, mejoraran decididamente la calidad de materias metalicas y de esta manera satisfaran la demanda de materiales de hierro en la economia nacional. Es indispensable asegurarle sin falta, antes que otros sectores y segun el plan la electricidad, los minerales de hierro, la antracita, el lignito, los vagones, las locomotoras y los fondos, para que cumpla incondicionalmente la meta de produccion de materiales de hierro y acero para el proximo ano y logre sin falta adecuarse a las condiciones del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector de la industria quimica aceleraran la fundacion de la industria de carbono uno, impulsaran conforme al plan la construccion de una base productora de catalizadores y una fabrica de abonos fosforicos y remodelaran el proceso de produccion de carbonato de soda a partir de la glauberita como materia prima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la industria mecanica modernizaran la Fabrica de Tractores Kum Song, el Complejo Automovilistico \"Sungri\" y otras plantas e inventaran y produciran a nuestra manera maquinas y equipos de nivel mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso renovar conjuntamente la extraccion de minerales como el carbon y el transporte ferroviario, para que tenga efecto el cimiento de la independiente economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, al sector ferroviario le compete aprovechar con la mayor eficiencia la actual capacidad de transporte al organizarlo y dirigirlo de manera cientifica y racional y establecer una ferrea disciplina y orden como en el ejercito a favor de la circulacion puntual y sin accidentes del tren.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano es imprescindible operar cambios en el mejoramiento de la vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fabricas de la industria ligera deben ahorrar la mano de obra y la electricidad mediante la remodelacion de equipos y procesos de produccion, y producir y suministrar mas articulos de consumo de gran variedad y calidad con materias primas y materiales del pais. A las provincias, ciudades y distritos les incumbe desarrollar con peculiaridad sus respectivas economias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que lograr un ascenso en la agricultura y la pesca. Es aconsejable cumplir sin falta el plan de la produccion cerealera al introducir en gran escala las excelentes variedades, el cultivo de alto rendimiento, las maquinas eficientes y los ultimos logros cientificos y tecnologicos, asi como aumentar la produccion del ganado, frutas y de verduras y hongos en el invernadero. Es preciso elevar la capacidad de construir y reparar barcos, aplicar metodos cientificos en pesca y activar la maricultura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano los militares y civiles deben unir la fuerza para terminar cuanto antes la construccion de la zona turistica costera Wonsan -Kalma, impulsar las obras importantes como el acondicionamiento del distrito de Samjiyon, la construccion de la central hidroelectrica de Tanchon y la segunda etapa del canal de riego en la provincia de Hwanghae del Sur y seguir poniendo un gran empeno en la construccion de viviendas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imprescindible ampliar los exitos en la reforestacion, proteger y cuidar bien los bosques ya repoblados, y al mismo tiempo mejorar el estado tecnico de las carreteras, rehabilitar periodicamente las riberas y proteger el medio ambiente con metodos cientificos y el sentido de responsabilidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los sectores y unidades de la economia nacional movilizaran todas sus fuerzas tecnicas y potencial economico y se esforzaran por la produccion y el ahorro, con miras a incrementar los bienes materiales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl atajo para el desarrollo independiente de la economia es anteponer las ciencias y la tecnologia y renovar la operacion y la direccion economicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector de la investigacion cientifica estableceran nuestros autoctonos procesos de produccion, utilizaran materias primas, materiales y equipos de nuestro pais y concederan prioridad a resolver problemas cientificos y tecnicos que se plantean para el perfeccionamiento de una estructura economica independiente. En todos los renglones y unidades de la economia nacional deben promover la difusion de conocimientos cientificos y tecnicos y activar el movimiento por la innovacion tecnica, para asi contribuir a la mayor produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Consejo de Ministros y otros organismos de direccion economica deben elaborar con el sentido de la realidad el proyecto de operaciones para cumplir el plan de la economia nacional del presente ano e impulsar su ejecucion con responsabilidad y teson. El Estado tomara medidas decisivas para lograr que el sistema socialista de la responsabilidad de la empresa en la administracion surta realmente efecto en fabricas, empresas y cooperativas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs recomendable desarrollar en todos los aspectos la cultura socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEngrosaran las filas de profesores, renovaran el contenido y el metodo docentes en atencion a la tendencia actual de la ensenanza, mostraran plenamente el espiritu de beneficiar al pueblo en los servicios medicos, fabricaran mas equipos y aparatos medicos y elaboraran gran variedad de medicamentos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario fomentar el deporte entre las masas e introducir nuestras propias tecnicas deportivas y metodos de competencia. Hace falta componer obras maestras que reflejan veridicamente la lucha heroica, la vida y las bellas y nobles virtudes de nuestro ejercito y pueblo de la epoca de Mallima, con el objetivo de aplastar la cultura burguesa y reaccionaria con ayuda del arte y la literatura de caracter revolucionario y socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHan de observar estrictamente los principios y las reglas morales en toda la sociedad, implantar el estilo de vida socialista y arreciar la lucha para erradicar todos los fenomenos no socialistas, de modo que todos lleven una vida revolucionaria y culta con nobles rasgos espirituales y morales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs indispensable reforzar mas nuestra capacidad de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este ano en que se cumplen 70 anos de la reorganizacion del Ejercito Revolucionario Popular de Corea en fuerzas armadas regulares por el gran Lider, el Ejercito Popular de Corea debe perfeccionarse como tropas revolucionarias del Partido y preparar a todas sus unidades de diferentes tropas, armas y especialidades para combatir cada uno a cien enemigos al intensificar los ejercicios militares creando un ambiente similar al de la batalla real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea le atane aguzar el sentido en la lucha clasista, descubrir y aplastar a tiempo las conjuras de los elementos espurios y hostiles. A los miembros de la Guardia Roja Obrero-Campesina y la Guardia Roja Juvenil les corresponde intensificar ejercicios militares y politicos para elevar por todos los medios su combatividad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mantener invariablemente la linea del desarrollo paralelo de acuerdo con la orientacion estrategica presentada por el Partido en la VIII Conferencia de la Industria de Defensa Nacional, en la industria de defensa nacional inventaran y produciran a nuestro estilo poderosas armas estrategicas y otros pertrechos, perfeccionaran una autoctona estructura de produccion y modernizaran los procesos de produccion sobre la base de las ciencias y la tecnologia de punta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos sectores de la investigacion de armas nucleares y de la industria coheteril daran acicate a la produccion masiva y emplazamiento de ojivas nucleares y cohetes balisticos, que tienen ya confirmadas su potencia y fiabilidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiempre estaran predispuestos para el inmediato contraataque nuclear frente a las maniobras de la guerra nuclear del enemigo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl poderio ideologico y politico constituye el primer potencial de nuestro Estado y una gran fuerza que impulsa la edificacion de la potencia socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara cumplir exitosamente nuestras tareas, es preciso elevar de continuo la combatividad y capacidad de direccion del Partido sobre el conjunto de la revolucion y la labor constructiva mediante la estrecha cohesion ideologica y organizativa de todo el Partido y el estricto establecimiento de un ambiente revolucionario de trabajo en el Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las organizaciones del Partido no toleraran jamas las ideas nocivas de toda clase ni la dualidad en la disciplina, contrarias a la idea del Partido, y consolidaran por todos los medios la unidad monolitica de todo el Partido en torno a su Comite Central.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario intensificar la lucha por establecer un ambiente revolucionario de trabajo en el Partido concentrandose en erradicar los viejos metodos y estilos de trabajo como el abuso de autoridad y el burocratismo, con vistas a estrechar mas los lazos consanguineos entre el Partido y las masas populares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las organizaciones del Partido les compete intensificar la direccion sobre las labores de sectores y unidades correspondientes, de manera que ellas se realicen conforme a la idea y el proposito del Partido y la demanda de su politica, asi como resolver exitosamente los problemas que se plantean en la construccion de la potencia socialista al anteponer la labor politica y movilizar la idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta unir con una misma idea y voluntad a todo el ejercito y pueblo en torno al Partido, para que corran el mismo destino con el Partido en cualquier adversidad y luchen a costa de vida para la victoria de la causa socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones del Partido, las de trabajadores y los organos del poder deben encauzar y subordinar todas las labores a consolidar la unidad monolitica. Tienen que planificar y desarrollar el trabajo teniendo como pautas la exigencia y los intereses del pueblo, adentrarse en las masas y compartir con ellas las penas y las alegrias atenuando sus sufrimientos y resolviendo las dificultades en su vida. Urge poner de manifiesto el bello rasgo de la ayuda y el sincero afecto entre companeros y vecinos, mucho mas ahora en que todo escasea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que movilizar plenamente la indoblegable fuerza espiritual del heroico pueblo coreano en el actual gran avance de Mallima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones del Partido y de trabajadores induciran a todos sus miembros a lograr de continuo las innovaciones colectivas en la gran obra para la creacion de la velocidad de Mallima, al grabar en sus corazones el patriotismo y tomar como fuerza motriz el espiritu revolucionario de apoyo en sus propias fuerzas, las ciencias y la tecnologia. Todos los funcionarios, militantes y trabajadores deben ser vanguardias de la epoca de Mallima, heredando el espiritu de lucha de generaciones antecedentes que produjeron cambios del siglo en su gran avance de Chollima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado, como en otros, nuestro pueblo batallo con dinamismo por defender la paz y lograr la reunificacion del pais cuanto antes posible en correspondencia con la aspiracion e imperativo de la nacion. Sin embargo, Estados Unidos y sus seguidores recurrieron a las draconianas medidas de sancion y presion y demenciales maniobras de provocacion de la guerra para impedir el crecimiento de las fuerzas de disuasion nuclear de nuestra Republica llevando la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana a una tension sin precedentes y poniendo mayores obstaculos y dificultades para la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas relaciones Norte-Sur siguen en su estado de antes aun despues de la caida del \"gobierno\" conservador que persistia en la politica fascista y de enfrentamiento fratricida y la presencia de otro nuevo poder en el Sur debido a la energica resistencia de los diferentes sectores de la poblacion. Las nuevas autoridades surcoreanas, en contra del anhelo de la nacion por la reunificacion, se alinean con Estados Unidos que se aferra a la politica de hostilidad contra la RPDC empeorando la situacion, y agravando la tension y llevando la desconfianza y el enfrentamiento a tal punto que es dificil resolver el problema Norte-Sur. Si no acabamos con el actual estado anormal, no podremos alcanzar la reunificacion ni mucho menos evitar la catastrofica guerra nuclear que las fuerzas extranas nos impongan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion exige que el Norte y el Sur, libres de la vieja posicion, adopten decisivas medidas para mejorar sus relaciones y abrir el camino para la reunificacion independiente del pais. Si no prestamos oidos a esta encarecida voz de la epoca no podremos, sea quien sea, presentarnos con la frente levantada ante la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano sera el de jubilo para ambas partes pues en el Norte va a conmemorarse como gran fiesta el aniversario 70 de la fundacion de su Republica y en el Sur se celebraran los juegos olimpicos invernales. Para asegurar con exito dichos acontecimientos trascendentales y demostrar plenamente el espiritu y dignidad de la nacion nos corresponde mejorar las congeladas relaciones Norte-Sur de modo que este ano sea de relevancia historica para la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso, ante todo, aliviar la aguda tension militar entre las dos partes y preparar las condiciones propicias para la paz en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la actual situacion inestable, la de no guerra ni de paz, el Norte y el Sur no podrian asegurar sus actividades programadas, sostener conversaciones fructiferas para el mejoramiento de las relaciones ni tampoco avanzar recto hacia la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA ambas partes les compete dejar de agudizar la situacion y optar por acciones unitarias a favor de paliar la tension militar y propiciar la circunstancia de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa autoridad del Sur no debe atizar la aguda situacion al asociarse con Estados Unidos en su peligroso plan de provocacion de la guerra nuclear contra el Norte que amenaza la existencia de la nacion y la paz y estabilidad de esta tierra, sino unirse con nosotros que hacemos todos los medios posibles para lograr la distension. Dejara de realizar todo tipo de ejercicios de guerra nuclear conjuntos con las fuerzas extranjeras que podrian empujar nuestro territorio al mar de fuego y sangre, e introducir armas nucleares y fuerzas agresoras norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstados Unidos, aunque trata con frenesi de provocar una guerra esgrimiendo sus armas nucleares, no podra lograr su designio ya que tenemos potencialidades preventivas. El Norte y el Sur, si se unen, pueden conjurar la guerra y asegurar la distension en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario crear un ambiente favorable para la reconciliacion entre los compatriotas y la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mejoramiento de las relaciones Norte-Sur es el problema de primer orden que interesa no solo a sus autoridades sino tambien a todo coreano y una importantisima cuestion que todos debemos revolver con las fuerzas unidas. Ambas partes promoveran contactos, viajes, colaboraciones e intercambios en diferentes sectores para eliminar el malentendimiento y desconfianza cumpliendo asi su responsabilidad y desempeno como protagonistas de la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbriremos la puerta de conversaciones, contactos y viajes a todos los que desean con sinceridad la reconciliacion y unidad de la nacion, incluidos no solo el partido gubernamental sino tambien otros opositores, organizaciones de distintos sectores y personalidades individuales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imprescindible eliminar decisivamente los actos que hieren a otra parte y atizan las discordias y hostilidades entre los compatriotas. La autoridad surcoreana debe propiciar condiciones y ambiente favorables para la reconciliacion y unidad de la nacion, en lugar de impedir los contactos y viajes de diferentes sectores y reprimir la solidaridad con el Norte a favor de la reunificacion, valiendose de injustos pretextos, leyes y aparatos institucionales, como lo hizo el anterior poder conservador.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara mejorar cuanto antes las relaciones Norte-Sur es ineludible que las autoridades del Norte y del Sur cumplan con su responsabilidad y papel asumidos ante la epoca y la nacion enarbolando mas que nunca la bandera de la independencia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas relaciones Norte-Sur es sin duda, un asunto interno de nuestra nacion y ambas partes deben desempenar el papel protagonico en su solucion, razon por la cual debemos mantener la firme posicion de resolver todos los problemas entre el Norte y el Sur ateniendonos al principio de Entre nosotros, los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa autoridad surcoreana debe tener presente que si lleva el problema de las relaciones Norte-Sur a otros paises para pedir la ayuda en su solucion no puede conseguir nada y, al contrario, darles pretextos para la intervencion a las fuerzas foraneas de mala intencion, y complicar el problema. No es el momento de darle la espalda una parte a otra insistiendo en sus opiniones sino el de consultar detenidamente sentadas en la mesa para mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas y abrir audazmente el camino para la solucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos juegos olimpicos de invierno que se efectuaran pronto en Corea del Sur seran una buena oportunidad para demostrar la dignidad de la nacion y deseamos de corazon su exitosa celebracion. Por eso estamos dispuestos a tomar medidas pertinentes como el envio de nuestra delegacion y consideramos necesario un urgente contacto gubernamental de ambas partes. Es natural que entre los compatriotas de una misma sangre, se considere la alegria de otros como la suya y se ayuden mutuamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn adelante tambien resolveremos todos los problemas entre nosotros, los connacionales, enarbolando la bandera de la independencia nacional y frustraremos con las fuerzas unidas de la nacion las maniobras de los elementos internos y externos que se oponen a la reunificacion, para escribir una nueva historia de la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esta oportunidad hago llegar de nuevo mis cordiales saludos a todos los compatriotas dentro y fuera del pais y deseo de corazon que en este ano significativo todo salga bien en el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion internacional del ano pasado comprobo que es justa la decision y opcion estrategica de nuestro Partido y Estado de contestar solo con la fuerza de la justicia a los agresores imperialistas que destruyen la paz y seguridad en el mundo y tratan de causarle un holocausto nuclear a la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro pais, consciente de su responsabilidad como potencia nuclear amante de la paz, no utilizara armas nucleares mientras las fuerzas agresivas hostiles no violen la soberania e interes de nuestro Estado, y tampoco amenaza con las mismas a ningun otro pais y region. Pero le daremos una respuesta categorica a todo acto que destruya la paz y seguridad en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro Partido y nuestro Gobierno desarrollaran las relaciones de buena vecindad y amistad con todas las naciones que respetan la soberania de nuestro pais y nos tratan con amistad y esforzaran activamente para construir un nuevo mundo justo y pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano 2018 sera otro ano de victorias para nuestro pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este momento en que se inicia la marcha impetuosa del nuevo ano me siento seguro pensando que nuestra causa siempre sale victoriosa por disfrutar del apoyo del pueblo y reafirmo mi decision de hacer todo lo posible para responder a las expectativas del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Partido del Trabajo de Corea y el Gobierno de la Republica, estimulados por la confianza y la gran fuerza del pueblo, no detendran su lucha y marcha hasta lograr la victoria final de la causa revolucionaria del Juche y anticiparan el futuro de la potencia socialista en que todo el pueblo disfrute de una vida digna y dichosa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Marchemos todos con pasos firmes por la nueva victoria de la revolucion haciendo gala del valeroso e inflexible espiritu de la Corea heroica guiada por el Partido del Trabajo de Corea!"
