            "content": "FM Spokesman on DPRK's Stand on Nuclear Freeze and Way of Verification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Wednesday as regards the misinformation floated by some members of the international community about the objects to be frozen and the way of verification after the DPRK elaborated on the proposal on \"reward for freeze\" at the third round of the six-party talks:\r\n As already reported, all participants in the six-party talks except the U.S. expressed positive understanding and sympathy with the flexible proposal the DPRK made as the first-phase measure for a package solution based on simultaneous actions at the talks. They expressed their willingness to participate in implementing the proposal for reward for freeze and even the broad world public fairly assessed the DPRK's constructive stand for the solution of the nuclear issue. \r\n The DPRK, however, is compelled to be vigilant against some forces misinterpreting the DPRK's stand in a bid to build up public opinion swimming against this international trend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They assert that the DPRK's nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose are possible only after its return to NPT and under its regular cooperation with the IAEA and that even the DPRK side expressed understanding of this. They also claim that the DPRK has the stand of agreeing to the multi-party inspection i.e. the six participant nations of the six-party talks, although it opposes the IAEA's inspection of its nuclear freeze. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK would like to reclarify its stand here. Its ultimate goal is to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will dismantle its nuclear weapons program only when conditions for it are created by the U.S. drop of its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, it wishes to wipe out mistrust and build confidence between the DPRK and the U.S. by implementing the measure of \"reward for freeze,\" to begin with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will naturally return to NPT if the Korean peninsula is denuclearized and those fundamental elements, which compelled the DPRK to pull out of the treaty, are consequently removed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable stand of the DPRK that it can not stop its nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose before this happens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose are the issues pertaining to its sovereignty and this should never be included in the objects to be frozen or dismantled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is a hard reality in the world that those countries outside NPT and those belonging to the nuclear-free zones are engaged in nuclear activities for peaceful purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, quite natural for the DPRK, a non-member country of NPT, to exercise such equal right even before its return to it and there is nothing strange about its nuclear activity for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the stand of the DPRK on the issue of verification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK, a freeze is the first phase leading to the final dismantlement of its nuclear program and the freeze is bound to be accompanied by an objective verification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By verification the DPRK means monitoring the state of freeze. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of inspection of the nuclear facilities and nuclear substance of the DPRK is something to be discussed only at the phase of dismantling its nuclear program. It is very illogical to argue about inspection from the phase of freeze. Moreover, any attempt to force the DPRK to accept it is nothing but a sinister attempt to disarm it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEven after the third round of the six-party talks high-ranking officials of the U.S., in fact, do not hide their attempt to force the DPRK to \"scrap its nuclear program first,\" asserting that they cannot make any reward unless the DPRK completely dismantles its nuclear program after halting its nuclear activity and accepting international inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite preposterous for the U.S. to urge the DPRK to disarm itself before anything else under the present situation where the two countries are in a state of armistice and technically at war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, therefore, can never accept this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. aggression and high-handed practices are rampant in the world and the dark clouds of a war are gathering to hang over the Korean peninsula hour by hour owing to the U.S. imperialists, but the Korean nation is paving the way for reunification thanks to the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The road of national independence the nation is taking under the banner of the joint declaration leads to peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Originally the issue of Korea's reunification did not surface owing to the contradictions among Koreans but was forced upon them by foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere is no ground for Koreans to fight each other over the issue of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. keen to dominate all the Koreans is to blame for the military confrontation and escalating tension on the Korean peninsula. National independence is the best option for saving the destiny of the Korean nation and a prerequisite to the peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration calls for achieving reunification by federal formula, a goal to be attained by the Koreans themselves, opening a bright prospect of the peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration underscores the need to work hard to achieve reunification by preserving the common points in the reunification proposals put forward by the north and the south to meet the nation's requirements and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt also makes it clear that the north and the south should develop national economy in a balanced manner through the economic cooperation between them and realize cooperation and exchange in all social fields to promote the bilateral confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From a realistic point of view achieving reunification by federal formula is the only way for the nation to solve the issue of the reunification of the country most smoothly and peacefully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation all Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should unanimously support and uphold the Songun politics aimed to protect the destiny of the nation, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
