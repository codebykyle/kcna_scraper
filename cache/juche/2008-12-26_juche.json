            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Indicted for Driving Inter-Korean Relations to Crisis\r\nPyongyang, December 25 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute (NRI) Wednesday made public an indictment clarifying who is the arch criminal that has driven the inter-Korean relations to the worst phase and who is to blame for having bedeviled them.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe deteriorated inter-Korean relations are entirely attributable to the sycophancy and treachery and anti-DPRK confrontation pursued by the Lee Myung Bak group, the indictment notes, citing the following facts to prove them:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the very first day of their office the south Korean authorities totally nullified and scrapped the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee Myung Bak regime asserted that the above-said declarations signed with the north by the preceding regimes are null and void and it is not obliged to implement them, crying out for regaining \"the lost decade.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group adopted the \"theory of giving priority to the south Korea-U.S. relations\" as its policy in a bid to stamp out the main spirit of the declarations and bring down their foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime declared \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" as its \"policy towards the north\" in violation of the above-said declarations. When the criticism of this policy mounted, it has more desperately pursued confrontation with fellow countrymen after covering it with the veil of the hypocritical watchword \"co-existence and co-prosperity.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors took part in \"co-sponsoring\" a \"resolution on the human rights issue in north Korea\" to be submitted to the UN General Assembly, pursuant to the U.S. policy in November. It staged a reckless lobbying operation to get the paragraph supporting the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration in the draft document deleted from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north-south dialogue and cooperation were suspended overnight due to the Lee Myung Bak regime though they had gained in scope and strength since the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration amid the expectation and concern of all the fellow countrymen and public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe regime put up \"denuclearization, reform and opening\" as a precondition for improving the inter-Korean relations, thus rejecting dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is investigating those organizations and businesses involved in the north-south cooperation undertakings and putting financial pressure upon them, etc, in a bid to force them to give up their participation of their own accord.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group has selectively barred and restricted the visits to the DPRK by the reunification movement organizations and other nongovernmental organizations of various circles and suppressed them, thus obstructing nongovernmental-level contacts and visits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traitorous clique unilaterally stopped the tour of Mt. Kumgang, which has been under way for the last decade amid the concern of the public at home and abroad, under the pretext of the case of a tourist that happened at Mt. Kumgang resort in last July.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group perpetrated an unpardonable provocation against the system in the north, extremely chilling the north-south atmosphere and driving the cooperation undertakings including the tour of Kaesong and the construction of KIZ to the crisis of total halt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group kicked up a row by bringing someone's non-existent \"human rights\" issue to the UN. This resulted in the closure of the Red Cross Liaison Office in Panmunjom, which has existed for several decades since early in the 1970s, and the cut-off of all the hot lines, which have been used as means for liaison between the north and the south, and made it impossible to conduct even humanitarian cooperation undertakings including reunion of separated families and relatives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities have desperately kicked up the anti-DPRK rackets to slander and stifle fellow countrymen under the pretexts of the \"nuclear issue\" and \"human rights issue.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group strengthened the posture for confrontation with the north, voicing opposition to the U.S. measure of delisting the DPRK as \"a state sponsor of terrorism,\" complaining that south Korea \"cannot agree with it.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is laying hurdles in the way of the six-party talks, vociferating about \"complete and accurate nuclear declaration\" and \"collection of samples.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the recent meeting of heads of the delegations to the six-party talks the group behaved worse than any others under the pretext of \"verification\" in collusion with its U.S. and Japanese masters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities' anti-DPRK confrontational nature found a more vivid manifestation in the fact that they have become frantic in their moves for a war of aggression against fellow countrymen, trumpeting about \"contingency\" and \"preemptive attack.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the Lee group which is talking about \"co-existence and co-prosperity\" and \"sincerity\" on one hand and sharpening swords to kill fellow countrymen in collusion with the U.S. warlike forces on the other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is as clear as a pikestaff that the north-south relations will further deteriorate as long as the Lee Myung Bak regime persists in confrontation and war moves, negating the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and standing in the way of dialogue and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the south Korean authorities are allowed to go on as what they do now, nobody knows what extreme crisis will happen in the days ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities had better ponder over the present inter-Korean relations if they do not want to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors who met a disgraceful end while going mad with confrontation with fellow countrymen."

However, the puppets talked nonsense crying out for \"re-listing\" as if they were invested with a certain mandate. This is a product of the despicable plot to woo their American master to steadily deteriorate the DPRK-U.S. relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy doing so, the Lee Myung Bak group has added to the crimes it has already committed against the nation.

de acusacion para revelar quien es el responsable de la actual coyuntura catastrofica de las relaciones Norte-Sur a punto de ruptura total.\n\t\t\t\t\tTras afirmar citando datos que el servilismo a grandes potencias y la maniobra conflictiva con el Norte de la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak del Sur de Corea llevaron al caos las relaciones intercoreanas, el documento senala como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el principio de su mandato, las autoridades surcoreanas convirtieron en letra muerta la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJurando rescatar los supuestos \"10 anos perdidos\", el \"poder\" de Lee declaro que son invalidas dichas declaraciones acordadas entre su antecesor y el Norte y no tiene la obligacion de implementarlas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, al tomar por su consigna politica la \"teoria de dar prioridad a las relaciones Sur de Corea-EE.UU.\", viola el espiritu fundamental de las dos declaraciones e intenta destruir la base de ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefinio la doctrina de \"desnuclearizacion, apertura y 3000 dolares\" como la \"politica sobre el Norte\" y cuando crecieron las criticas a esta, la disimulo con las enganosas palabras de \"convivencia y coprosperidad\" recurriendo tenazmente en realidad a la confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSumandose a la campana anti-RPDC de EE.UU., esta horda de traidores se ofrecio en noviembre pasado como uno de los \"co-proponentes\" en la Asamblea General de la ONU del llamado \"proyecto de resolucion sobre la situacion de DDHH del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta ocasion cometio la locura de pedir la exclusion de la frase de apoyo a las declaraciones intercoreanas, que estaba incluida en el borrador del proyecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dialogo y la cooperacion entre el Norte y el Sur, que despues de la aprobacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, se ampliaban y se desarrollaban a buen ritmo centrando las expectativas y atencion de todos los compatriotas y extranjeros, cayeron de repente en la coyuntura de suspension debido al \"regimen\" de Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste \"poder\" rehusa el dialogo presentando como la premisa del mejoramiento de las relaciones entre las dos partes coreanas la \"renuncia del arma nuclear\" y la \"reforma y apertura\" por el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMediante la investigacion y la presion financiera, obliga a las entidades y empresas involucradas en la  cooperacion Norte-Sur a sacar la mano de esta labor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY al interrumpir, restringir y reprimir selectivamente la visita a la RPDC de las entidades del movimiento por la reunificacion y las otras civiles de distintos estratos, pone obstaculos al contacto y viaje reciproco a nivel no gubernamental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto del incidente de la turista al monte Kumgang ocurrido en julio pasado, suspendio unilateralmente el turismo a este famoso monte que prosiguio durante 10 anos bajo la atencion de los nacionales y extranjeros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPerpetro imperdonables locuras provocativas al regimen de la RPDC envenenando asi el ambiente de las relaciones Norte-Sur, con lo cual corren el riesgo de cese total los proyectos de cooperacion como el turismo a Kaesong y la construccion de la zona industrial en esta urbe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe mal en peor, al escandalizar hasta en la ONU el inexistente problema \"DDHH\" del Norte, produjo el cierre de la oficina de enlace de la cruz roja en Phanmunjom, que existio durante varios decenios desde principios de la decada de 1970, la ruptura total de las lineas telefonicas directas que servian de medio de comunicaciones entre Norte y Sur y el aborto de las labores de cooperacion humanitaria como el encuentro entre los familiares y parientes separados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el rotulo del \"problema nuclear\" y el de \"DDHH\", las autoridades surcoreanas libran una feroz campana anti-RPDC para difamar y aplastar a los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHicieron mas ferrea su posicion conflictiva con la RPDC diciendo que \"no pueden estar a favor\" de la medida de EE.UU. de excluirla de la lista de los \"paises que apoyan el terrorismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn lo tocante a las conversaciones a 6 partes, estan frenando el avance de esta cita hablando de la supuesta \"declaracion nuclear total y exacta\" y la \"toma de muestras\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la reciente reunion entre los jefes de las delegaciones a la cita seis-partita, se portaron peor en complicidad con sus amos gringo y japones en torno al problema de \"verificacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa naturaleza conflictiva con la RPDC de las autoridades surcoreanas se manifiesta patentemente en que ellas recrudecen su maniobra belicista contra los connacionales hablando de la eventual \"situacion bruscamente cambiada\" y del \"ataque preventivo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon preciosamente los compinches de Lee quienes hablan de cara a cara de la \"convivencia y coprosperidad\" y de la \"sinceridad\" y afilan a espaldas el sable para agredir a los connacionales en contubernio con las fuerzas belicistas norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs evidente que iran de mal en peor las relaciones Norte y Sur, si el \"poder\" de Lee sigue negando las dos declaraciones intercoreanas, impidiendo el dialogo y la cooperacion y recurriendo a la confrontacion y guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSucedera otra circunstancia extremada de imprevisible consecuencia si las autoridades surcoreanas siguen actuando como ahora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllas deberan tener prudencia en la gestion del problema de las relaciones con el Norte si no quieren seguir el ejemplo de sus antecesores que tuvieron un fin ignominioso por sus freneticas maniobras de confrontacion fratricida."
