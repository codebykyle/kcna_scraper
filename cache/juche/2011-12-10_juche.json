            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Various Domains of South Hamgyong Province\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to different domains of Hamhung City, South Hamgyong Province which takes the lead in the vigorous drive for great surge under the torch kindled in the province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First he went to the Water-Supply Settling Basin of the February 8 Vinalon Complex,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Very pleased to see newly changed scenery of the basin overflowing with clean water including retaining wall, waterway wall, pumping station, sluice facility and handrails, he gave a high appreciation of servicepersons' heroic feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I came to take to heart again the irrefutable truth that we can win only victory despite any trial and adversity and work miracles of the history thanks to the revolutionary soldier spirit, the offensive spirit of \"at a breath\" cherished by the servicepersons through their sacred struggle to be remembered by the country and the people and to remain long in the history, he said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second leg of his guidance was the Sub-plant of the Ryongsong Machine Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Touring processing shop, heat treatment workteam and other parts of the sub-plant, he acquainted himself in detail with technological updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing CNC machine tools newly installed at the processing shop, he said with pride that we can put the industrial establishments on a modern basis as we please because we have the powerful Ryonha General Machinery Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction at the CNC spinning machine manufactured by the workers and technicians of the sub-plant with their concerted efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very good that the sub-plant has turned arrangement of equipment by kinds and processes to good account to reduce production area, shorten the product processing time and raise production efficiency, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also gave appreciation of the fact that the sub-plant has reduced the cost price of material heat treatment to the maximum by updating the heat treatment process through a vigorous technical innovation campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced tasks to be fulfilled by the sub-plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to speed up the work for putting the production process on a modern and scientific basis and positively introduce advanced technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also stressed that in order to turn out more quality advanced machines, it is important to steadily raise the level of technical skill of producers and, simultaneously, ensure the effective production organization and direction so that officials, workers and technicians can aspire to new things all the time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a picture taken with labor innovators. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third leg of his guidance was the Sinhungsan Chemical Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the general control room and other places of the factory to learn about its technological updating and production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While looking round modernly renovated production processes, he expressed satisfaction over the fact that the officials and employees of the factory successfully carried out huge project with their own efforts and technology and are now putting the production on a steady basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chemical industry is of great importance in strengthening the economic independence of the country and improving the people's living standard, he said, expressing belief that the officials and party members and other workers of the factory would fully discharge their honorable mission and duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He gave field guidance to Hamhung Knitting Mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He visited a room devoted to the history of the mill where he looked at the meaningful photo of President Kim Il Sung giving field guidance to the mill in May 1957 and materials indicative of the shining path covered by the mill under the wise guidance of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking round various places of the mill including the weaving shop, he acquainted himself with knitwear production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Carefully watching the operation of knitting equipment, he grasped the technical specifications of machines and daily production per machine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned in detail about the specific features and quality of the knitted cloth made of vinalon, fiber of our own invention and other chemical fibers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced the tasks before the mill. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He saw to it that a measure was taken to equip the mill with high-speed knitting machines, stressing the need to put the production processes on a high modern basis to drastically increase knitwear production and improve their quality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next he dropped in at Hungnam Shoes Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round a sample-display room, a preparation shop, a shoemaking shop and other places of the factory to learn about production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon hearing that the factory can boost footwear production now that it is supplied with vinyl chloride, raw material needed for shoemaking, by the February 8 Vinalon Complex, he said that the Complex greatly benefits the whole country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Carefully watching the patterns and smartness of shoes and learning about their weight, he called on the factory to further raise quality of goods as required by the consumers and trend.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory has a very important duty to fulfill in settling the footwear issue of the people in the province and the east coastal area, he said, putting forth tasks facing the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was Songchongang Exports Forwarding Office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Touring the seafood processing plant and indoor aquiculture tank and other places Kim Jong Il learned about the production potentials, aquatic products storage and processing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was very pleased to hear that processed marine products are strictly vacuum-packed and goods are delivered to fish shops and several commercial and public service outlets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He appreciated the extraction of chitinous acid from crab shells that had previously been disposed of.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned about the production of Nano goods with chitinous acid for various usage by the office together with teachers and researches of Kim Il Sung University and wished them successes through in-depth researches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching fishes including plaices, crabs and flatfishes that are kept alive in the indoor aquiculture tank, he learned about how long fishes can be stored alive since they were caught in the sea. He instructed officials to supply fresh fishes to the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He also gave field guidance to the vegetable greenhouse newly built in the Hoesang Area Farm in Hamhung City.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Touring eggplant block and other parts of the house, he learned about its construction and vegetable production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was very pleased with the fact that hothouses based on solar heat have been built there to provide sure guarantee for increasing vegetable production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is especially satisfactory that the house is able to turn out vegetables free from effects of contaminants and dust, he said.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that the greenhouse has an important role to play in improving the diet of Hamhung citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to increase per-hectare yield of hothouse vegetables, he said, it is needed to put production on an intensive basis and vegetable cultivation and management such as supply of water, fertilizer and chemicals and regulation of temperature and humidity on a modern basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also stressed the need to direct efforts to solving the scientific and technological problem for production of fruit-bearing vegetables in winter season and thus enrich the present success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Repeatedly appreciating the greenhouse as very perfect and flawless, he called for making it yield greater result so that inhabitants can get benefits substantially.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., WPK; Ju Kyu Chang, alternate member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., WPK; Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK; and Ri Jae Il and Pak Pong Ju, first vice department directors of the C.C., WPK."

Korean Conservative Media \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Journalists Union of Korea (JUK) Central Committee Saturday made public a statement denouncing the ultra-right conservative media for resorting to undisguised arbitrary practices under the patronage of the south Korean puppet authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are toughening suppression of progressive media while exploiting reactionary ultra-right conservative media in tiding over the ruling crisis in the face of the people's anti-\"government\" sentiment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chosun Ilbo, Choongang Ilbo, Dong-A Ilbo and Maeil Kyongje and other conservative newspapers of south Korean took control of the wired TV channel and began service from Dec. 1 backed by the authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the conservative papers deceived people and misled the public opinion by carrying false and deceptive news stories in the papers only. But now they monopolized the wired TV channel, means of a big role in building up public opinion. This created an abnormal situation whereby treachery and injustice insult patriotism and justice in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean opposition parties and different social strata including media protested against the starting of the wired TV channel describing it as \"conservative forces' attempt to monopolize media market\", \"a gimmick to prolong the remaining days of the present regime\" and \"a sordid scenario aimed at victory in general election and presidential elections\". Other TV broadcasting agencies and newspapers strongly rebuffed the move by denying the production of broadcasting materials and putting blank ads. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By use of ultra-right media the puppet authorities seek to build up public opinions in favor of them and tide over the ruling crisis and evade the people's punishment in the National Assembly election and \"presidential\" elections due next year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The JUK Central Committee in the name of all the journalists and mediapersons of the DPRK bitterly denounced the arbitrariness practiced by the south Korean conservative media as an unpardonable crime abusing justice, truth, mindset and conscience of people and a despicable move to turn south Korean society rightwing and fascist. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   It went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media is a mouthpiece for justice, conscience and truth and harbinger of the era. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the authorities' moves to grasp media and the arbitrary practices of conservative media agencies following them are overlooked, justice, conscience and truth will be violated and injustice, treachery, confrontation and anti-reunification moves will stalk in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean mediapersons and other people from all walks of life should never allow the moves of the authorities keen on staying in power by putting media on government payroll and rendering it reactionary, and the hackwork of ultra-right conservative writers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the mediapersons of south Korea should denounce the authorities' sycophantic, traitorous and fascist confrontation moves against reunification with the just writing brushes, patriotic microphones and radio waves for independence and democracy. They should also decisively shatter the authorities' ambition to remain in office and deal heavy blows to the ultra-right conservative media groups serving the power as a waiting maid. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities and conservative media agencies should clearly understand that arbitrariness, deception and intrigues going against the mindset of people will only bring stronger denunciation, protest and miserable end."

y el criadero bajo techo, el se cercioro de la base productiva de la empresa y del estado de conservacion y procesamiento de los productos maritimos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe mostro muy complacido al recibir el parte de que los productos se empaquetan al vacio y se suministran a las pescaderias y otros establecimientos de la red comercial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvaluo especialmente la extraccion del acido quitinoso de las cascaras de cangrejo que se desechaban anteriormente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn colaboracion con los profesores e investigadores de la Universidad Kim Il Sung, la empresa produce con el acido quitinoso los nano-productos con diversos usos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInformado de ello, formulo votos por hacer que la empresa logre buenos resultados al profundizar la investigacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContemplando peces en el criadero bajo techo, el Dirigente averiguo cuanto tiempo se puede conservarlos vivos desde la captura en el mar e instruyo suministrar al pueblo los pescados frescos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFinalmente, visito los invernaderos de verduras nuevamente construidos en la Granja Zonal de Hoesang de la ciudad de Hamhung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecorriendo varios puntos, averiguo el estado de construccion y produccion de verduras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe alegro mucho de que se haya dado la garantia de incrementar la produccion de vegetales gracias al acondicionamiento de invernaderos solares sin otros medios especificos de calefaccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que me agrada mas es que aqui pueden producir las verduras descontaminadas apartandolas de sustancias contaminantes y polvos, dijo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos invernaderos construidos en la Granja Zonal de Hoesang ocupan un lugar importante en el mejoramiento de la vida alimentaria de los ciudadanos de Hamhung, recalco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que intensificar la produccion y modernizar el cultivo de verduras y la gestion como el suministro de aguas, abonos y agroquimicos, la regulacion de temperatura y humedad para incrementar el rendimiento por hectarea en los invernaderos, preciso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDestaco la necesidad de ampliar los exitos de ahora al esforzarse por solucionar los problemas cientifico-tecnicos que se presentan en producir las verduras frutales en el invierno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolviendo a calificar de perfectos los invernaderos, el Dirigente encomendo encarecidamente que los operaran bien para que los habitantes puedan beneficiarse realmente de ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe acompanaron en esta ocasion Kim Kyong Hui, miembro del Buro Politico y jefa de departamento del Comite Central del PTC, Ju Kyu Chang, miembro suplente del BP y jefe de departamento del CC del PTC, Kwak Pom Gi, secretario responsable del Comite del PTC en la Provincia de Hamgyong del Sur, Ri Jae Il y Pak Pong Ju, primeros subjefes de departamento del CC del PTC."

Ademas, las emisoras de TV y las editoriales reaccionan fuertemente negando la redaccion de articulos de radiodifusion e insertando el anuncio blanco, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal conducta de la banda titere persigue el maligno intento de liberarse de la crisis de su gobernacion induciendo la opinion publica a su favor y evadir la sentencia publica en las elecciones parlamentarias y presidenciales que tendran lugar el ano siguiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl CC del UPC denuncia severamente en nombre de todos los periodistas y los hombres de prensa de la parte nortena de Corea las arbitrariedades de los medios de prensa ultraderechistas que actuan a su antojo bajo el amparo de la banda titere, calificandolas de imperdonable crimen que aplasta la justicia y la verdad, la opinion publica y la conciencia, y de astuta maniobra destinada a convertir la sociedad surcoreana en una ultraderechista y fascista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa prensa es el portavoz de la justicia, la conciencia y la verdad, asi como el precursor de la epoca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se dejan intactas las maniobras de la banda titere tendentes a controlar los medios de prensa, y las arbitrariedades de los medios de prensa ultraderechistas y conservadores serviles a ella, se exterminaran en el Sur de Corea la justicia, la conciencia y la verdad y reinaran solo la injusticia y la vendepatria, el enfrentamiento y la antireunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hombres de prensa y los habitantes de distintos estratos del Sur de Corea no deben permitir ni un minimo las maniobras de la camarilla titere y de los escritores comercializados ultraderechistas y conservadores encaminadas a retomar el poder convirtiendo los medios de prensa en los venales y reaccionarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hombres de prensa del Sur de Corea deben revelar y denunciar las tentativas serviles, vendepatrias, fascistas y anti-reunificacion de la banda titere con sus pinceles de justicia, microfonos patrioticos y radiodifusion independiente y democratica, frustrar rotundamente la ambicion de retomar el poder y dar un golpe fuerte a los medios de prensa ultraderechistas y conservadoros que  sirven de manera vergonzosa a la banda titere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere y los medios de prensa ultraderechistas y conservadoros deben darse clara cuenta de que con las arbitrariedades, brutalidades, mentiras y tergiversaciones, solo provocaran la mayor condena y protesta del pueblo y aceleraran su fin catastrofico."
