            "content": "DPRK Will Show in Practice Its Warning Is Not Empty Talk: CPRK\r\n Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Wednesday released a crucial report in connection with the fact that the reckless military provocations of the U.S. and the Park Geun Hye group of traitors of south Korea against the DPRK have gone beyond the tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t At the instigation of the U.S. imperialists the south Korean warmongers dared stage an outrageous \"precision strike drill\" aimed to destroy the office of the supreme headquarters of the DPRK on March 21 with 16 fighter bombers carrying air-to-surface guided missiles involved, the report said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a thrice-cursed provocation to the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and intolerable hideous confrontation action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under authorization, the CPRK clarifies the following actions to cope with the prevailing grave situation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From this moment all the actions of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK including the regular units of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the Workers-Peasant Red Guards, the Young Red Guards and all people will be oriented to launch a retaliatory battle of justice in order to resolutely eliminate the Park Geun Hye group of traitors on this land and under this sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The battle to be fought by the DPRK will be the sacred one for devotedly defending the leader and the one for annihilating the enemy without mercy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not hide the fact that it may start inside the Chongwadae or near it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We had already declared that all the dens of the enemy in south Korea including the Chongwadae are the primary targets of the ultra-precision strike means of the Strategic Force of the KPA ready to go into action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The powerful large-caliber multiple rocket launching systems of the invincible KPA artillery units are highly alerted to scorch the Chongwadae bossed by Park Geun Hye in a jiffy. Once their buttons are pushed, it is bound to be reduced to a sea in flames and ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA units behind enemy lines to be deployed in the operational theater of the southern part of Korea are fully ready to start a storm operation, lightning operation to conquer the Chongwadae and other major targets at one blow any time and mercilessly wipe out Park Geun Hye and other south Korean warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the Park group should clearly understand the will of all the service personnel and people of the DPRK to annihilate the enemy as they regard their supreme headquarters and dignity dearer than their own lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There's a limit to our patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the Park group of traitors had better pay heed to the DPRK's warning that it has done everything required after having access to everything necessary. They would be well advised to behave prudently, if they wish to spend their remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once it is determined, the DPRK will launch a preemptive attack operation of Korean style to wipe out not only the Park Geun Hye group of traitors but all big or small strongholds of aggression the way the world has never known.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the DPRK warns is not hot air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will be clearly proved by the miserable end the U.S. and the Park group will meet while going reckless."

Consequently, distorted history that Tok Islets belong to Japan will be taught at most of senior high schools in Japan in the wake of primary and secondary schools. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of Japan has persistently tampered with history, tailoring the standard for screening textbooks and \"teaching manuals\" to the stand of right-wing forces after amending the basic law on education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government revised the \"teaching manuals\" for secondary and senior high schools for 2014 so that Tok Islets are described as part of the inalienable territory of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It set up a \"Takeshima (Tok Islets) data room\" at the Shimane Prefectural Office of Japan in a desperate bid to increase the awareness of \"claim to Tok Islets\" among Japanese.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is leaving no means untried to implant the wrong picture of Tok Islets into the minds of the young Japanese.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, it brought out a fairy tale about the animal which was exterminated by Japanese while living in Tok Islets and organized a special lecture to convince them that Tok Islets belong to Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shimane Prefecture distributed among schools the map which wrongly marked the boundary of Japan between Ullung Island and Tok Islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government's serious moves to make textbooks veer to the Right and distort history through them find their manifestation in its undisguised scenario to distort history such as denying the coercion involved in the sexual slavery after reaching \"an agreement\" on the issue of the sexual slavery with the south Korean puppet regime in December, 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are absurd enough to falsify facts by teaching the students distorted history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History can neither be altered nor rewritten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some historical materials discovered in Japan prove that the then Japan itself recognized Tok Islets as part of the territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"complete map of Japan\" drawn by the Staff Department of the Ministry of Army of Japan in 1877 was obtained and opened to public in Japan some years before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The map dealt with the whole territory of Japan in detail but it did not mark Tok Islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets were not marked in the area catalogue of the map done by the Department of Land Survey of Japan in 1899 on the scale of 1:200,000.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many maps drawn till 1905 included Tok Islets in the territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The islets are an inalienable part of the territory of Korea unthinkable apart from the history of the Korean nation spanning 5000 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should properly face up to the reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days never to return when the Japanese imperialists could go reckless to grab others' territories and launch overseas aggression in the last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries can never translate into reality their militarist scenario for establishing the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\", which they failed to do in the past, by teaching the distorted history to the younger generation and thereby hurling them into overseas aggression and reinvasion of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to stop running amuck to grab others' territory, a daydream, but honestly redress its crime-woven past, to begin with."
