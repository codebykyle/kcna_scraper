            "content": "U.S. Urged to Honestly Apologize to Mankind for Its Evil Doing before Groundlessly Pulling up Others\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, December 21 (KCNA) -- The Policy Department of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK issued the following statement Sunday: \n\t\t\t\t\t Strange thing that happened in the heart of the U.S., the ill-famed cesspool of injustice, is now afloat in the world as shocking news.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Sony Pictures Entertainment, the biggest movie producer in the U.S., which produced the undesirable reactionary film \"The Interview\" daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and agitating even terrorism and had a plan to distribute it, was exposed to surprisingly sophisticated, destructive and threatening cyber warfare and has been thrown into a bottomless quagmire after suffering property losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The public in the U.S. is now describing this case as \"disgrace suffered by Sony Pictures Entertainment,\" \"very sorry thing caused by the U.S.,\" \"Sony Pictures Entertainment showing a white flag before hackers\" and the \"unprecedented disaster suffered by the U.S.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who meted out a stern punishment of justice were reported to be cyber experts styling themselves \"guardians of peace\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seized with terrible horror and threat in face of their merciless hacking attack in retaliation against unjust actions, many movie and drama distributors in North America including 41 states of the U.S. and Canada immediately canceled the screening of the reactionary movie. And it was reported that the Sony Pictures Entertainment which directly sponsored its production and distribution hastily issued a statement on Dec. 25 that it would suspend the screening of the undesirable movie which had been planned in 63 countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NDC of the DPRK highly estimates the righteous action taken by the \"guardians of peace,\" though it is not aware of their residence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It, at the same time, considers as fortunate the step taken by the Sony Pictures Entertainment to give up the overall distribution of the above-said movie due to the decision and strong pressure of the movie and drama distributors for stopping the screening of the reactionary movie, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an official stand of the army and the people of the DPRK on what happened in the heart of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This stand is taken by the DPRK because the movie \"The Interview\" is an undesirable and reactionary one justifying and inciting terrorism which should not be allowed in any country and any region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another reason is that the movie is run through with a story agitating a vicious and dastardly method of assassinating a head of a legitimate sovereign state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even political and social circles of the U.S. commented that it is quite wrong to defame the head of the state for the mere reason that his politics is different from that of the U.S. and it is in the hostile relationship with the latter and, therefore, the Sony Pictures Entertainment got into a serious trouble and paid a due price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For these reasons, the DPRK is more highly praising the \"guardians of peace\" for their righteous deed which prevented in advance the evil cycle of retaliation-- terrorism sparks terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the movie and drama producers should refrain from undesirable deeds contrary to the noble mission to lead morality and civilization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But what matters is that the U.S. and its followers are groundlessly trumpeting that the recent cyber attack was made by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The FBI issued the results of the investigation into the hack at the Sony Pictures Entertainment on December 19. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to them, it suffered tremendous losses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One may say this is the due price incurred by wrong deed, the evil act of hurting others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. released a statement asserting that this loss was caused by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how big and disgraceful the loss may be, the U.S. should not pull up others for no reason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The FBI presented a report on the results of technical analysis of hacking program used by the \"guardians of peace\" for this attack, citing it as the ground that the serious hacking was caused by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report says the malignant code had access to north Korea's IP already known several times and the hacking methods applied in the \"March 20 hacking case\" and during cyber warfare against media and various other computer networks in south Korea in recent years are similar to that applied against the Sony Pictures Entertainment this time, being another ground that \"this was done by the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report, in particular, adds that the malignant code and algorithm applied during the attack are similar to what was used during the hacking attack on south Korea, citing it as a proof.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not satisfied with those groundless \"evidence\", the FBI is letting loose ambiguous remarks that it is hard to fully prove due to the \"protection of sensitive information sources.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This means self-acknowledgement that the \"assertion about the north's deed\" came from an intentional allegation rather than scientific evidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a common sense that the method of cyber warfare is almost similar worldwide. Different sorts of hacking programs and codes are used in cyberspace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If somebody used U.S.-made hacking programs and codes and applied their instruction or encoding method, perhaps, the \"wise\" FBI, too, could not but admit that it would be hard to decisively assert that the attack was done by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the DPRK has never attempted nor made a \"cyber-attack\" on south Korea. The rumor about \"cyber-attack\" by the DPRK was a concoction made by the south Korean puppet regime and its plot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the grounds cited by the FBI in its announcement were all based on obscure sci-tech data and false story and, accordingly, the announcement itself is another fabrication. This is the DPRK's stand on the U.S. gangster-like behavior against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is grave is that U.S. President Obama is recklessly making the rumor about \"DPRK's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures\" a fait accompli while crying out for symmetric counteraction, strict calculation and additionally retaliatory sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is like beating air after being hit hard. A saying goes every sin brings its punishment with it. It is best for the guilty to repent of its evil doings and draw a lesson when forced to pay dearly for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is said that the movie was conceived and produced according to the \"guidelines\" of the U.S. authorities who contended that such movies hurting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and inciting terrorism against it would be used in an effective way as \"propaganda against north Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of State's special human rights envoy went the lengths of urging the movie makers to keep all scenes insulting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership in the movie, saying it is needed to \"vex the north Korean government\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The facts glaringly show that the U.S. is the chief culprit of terrorism as it has loudly called for combating terrorism everywhere in the world but schemed behind the scene to produce and distribute movies inciting it in various countries of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not exaggeration to say in the light of the prevailing situation that the U.S. administration and President Obama looking after the overall state affairs of the U.S. have been behind the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Can he really cover up the crimes he has committed by trying so hard to falsify the truth and turn white to black.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So we watched with unusual attention what had been done by the \"guardians of peace\" to avert terrorism and defend justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yet, we do not know who or where they are but we can surely say that they are supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK who aspire after justice and truth and value conscience have hundreds of millions of supporters and sympathizers, known or unknown, who have turned out in the sacred war against terrorism and the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, to accomplish the just cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obama personally declared in public the \"symmetric counteraction\", a disgraceful behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no need to guess what kind of thing the \"symmetric counteraction\" is like but the army and people of the DPRK will never be browbeaten by such a thing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target is all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the U.S. in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism, by far surpassing the \"symmetric counteraction\" declared by Obama.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the invariable toughest stand of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fighters for justice including \"guardians of peace\" who turned out in the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S. to defend human justice and conscience and to dismember the U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all sorts of evils and kingpin of injustice, are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The just struggle to be waged by them across the world will bring achievements thousands of times greater than the hacking attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the truth and inevitability of the historical development that justice prevails over injustice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever challenges justice by toeing the line of the biggest criminal U.S. will never be able to escape merciless punishment as it is the target of the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should reflect on its evil doings that put itself in such a trouble, apologize to the Koreans and other people of the world and should not dare pull up others."

Se dice que con ese ataque Sony Pictures Entertainment se encuentra a un punto de caer en un miserable caos por haber sufrido inmensos danos de bienes y fondos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien dentro de EE.UU. se oyen las voces como \"verguenza sufrida por 'Sony Pictures Entertainment'\", \"Cosa tan triste llamada por Estados Unidos\", \"'Sony Pictures Entertainment' que levanto la bandera blanca ante los hackers\" y la \"Catastrofe sin precedente sufrida por Estados Unidos de America\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien dicen que los protagonistas que asestaron el duro castigo de justicia son los especialistas ciberneticos autodenominados de \"defensores de la paz\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMuchas agencias de divulgacion de peliculas y dramas de 41 estados estadounidenses, Canada y de America del Norte, que sintieron gran pavor y amenaza ante tal despiadado ataque cibernetico contra la injusticia, cancelaron de inmediato la proyeccion de esa pelicula. Sony Pictures Entertainment, que tomo la iniciativa del rodaje y divulgacion de tal metraje, publico apresuradamente una declaracion de interrumpir su proyeccion programada el 25 de diciembre en 63 paises del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien no se saben la direccion y la residencia de los ejecutantes del ataque, el CDN de la RPDC aprecia mucho la accion honrada de los \"defensores de la paz\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY considera como afortunadas las medidas de \"Sony Pictures Entertainment\" que dejo de distribuir, aunque sea tarde, esa pelicula debido a la decision resuelta y la fuerte presion de las distribuidoras de peliculas y dramas que se decidieron a interrumpir la proyeccion de la pelicula reaccionaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos son la posicion oficial del ejercito y pueblo coreanos en cuanto al presente incidente ocurrido en el lugar centrico de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMantenemos tal posicion porque la pelicula \"The Interview\" es la reaccionaria que justifica  e incita el terrorismo que no debe ser tolerado en cualesquier paises y regiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOtra razon reside en que la pelicula esta penetrada por el contenido que agita las astutas y viles maneras para asesinar al jefe de un digno estado soberano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta los circulos politicos y sociales de Estados Unidos dicen que es un \"proceder muy  erroneo difamar al jefe del estado de ese pais (RPDC) por mas que este practique una politica diferente a la norteamericana y se encuentre en relaciones hostiles\" y que con tal motivo EE.UU. \"sufrio la miserable desgracia y la merecida  cuenta\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApreciamos altamente los justos actos de los \"defensores de la paz\" porque ellos impidieron de antemano la circulacion viciosa de venganza que genera de continuo el terrorismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un hecho muy razonable que las empresas de peliculas y dramas que deberian difundir la moralidad y la civilizacion no hayan participado en los actos malsanos en contrapelo de sus nobles misiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, lo problematico es que EE.UU. y las fuerzas seguidoras divulgan un rumor irrazonable como si el presente ataque cibernetico fuera el de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Buro Federal de Investigacion de EE.UU. (FBI) publico el dia 19 de diciembre el resultado de investigacion del caso de hacking \"Sony Pictures Entertainment\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun ello, podemos saber que es tan horrible el dano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria merecido el precio causado por las acciones injustas y la barbaridad que atentan a otros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el imperio publico una llamada declaracion de que tal precio fue causado por la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque son terribles y vergonzosos los danos sufridos, no debe cuestionar atrevidamente a otro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, FBI toma el resultado de analisis tecnico sobre el programa de hacking utilizado por los \"defensores de la paz\" en el presente ataque como procedencia de que el caso catastrofico ocurrio debido a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el resultado, se descubrio que el codigo maligno accedio varias veces a IP del Norte de Corea. Y las maneras de hacking son semejantes a las aplicadas en el \"incidente de hacking 20 de marzo\" y la ataque cibernetio contra networks locales de los medios y otros objetos que surgieron en los ultimos anos en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecialmente, el resultado anade que el codigo maligno y el algorithm aplicados en el presente ataque tienen unos puntos similares a los usados en el ataque cibernetico contra el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfechos con esas \"evidencias\" irrazonables, FBI habla inciertamente de que es imposible presentar otras pruebas debido a la \"proteccion de fuente de informaciones sensibles\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significa reconocer por si mismos que el rumor de \"acto del Norte de Corea\" no es la prueba cientifica sino la insistencia artificial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs el sentido comun el que el metodo de ataque cibernetico es casi igual en escala mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el espacio cibernetico se difunden los programas y codigos de Hacking de diversos tipos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi alguien hubiera usado el programa y el codigo de Hacking de EE.UU. y aplicado la palabra  imperativa y el metodo cifrado,   siquiera el FBI no habria reconocido que su pais lo haya hecho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no intento ni hizo nunca el ataque de Hacking en contra del Sur de Corea, connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto al ataque de Hacking de que hablan los titeres surcoreanos, estos son los disparates e intrigas inventados por ellos mismos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las pruebas publicadas por FBI estan basadas en los infundados datos cientificos y disparates inventados, razon por la cual la misma declaracion de FBI no pasa de ser un nuevo documento inventado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es nuestro criterio en cuanto a los actos bandidescos de EE.UU. que nos cuestiona perversamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa seriedad del problema  reside en que  el  mismo presidente norteamericano Obama proclamo como hecho consumado el rumor del \"acto del Norte de Corea\" en cuanto al caso de Sony Pictures Entertainment y maldijo que  \"tomaria la contramedida correspondiente, calcularia severamente el caso y haria la sancion de represalia adicional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl culpable debe ser castigado merecidamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria mejor que EE.UU. se reflexione profundamente de sus actos malintencionados y saque la leccion merecida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTenemos una clara prueba de que la administracion estadounidense haya intervenido profundamente en la produccion de tal pelicula reaccionaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDicen que se ha ideado y producido esa pelicula que calumnia directamente la maxima dignidad  de la RPDC e incita el terror segun la \"guia\" de la autoridades norteamericanas que decian que la \"pelicula servira de material de propaganda contra el Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiquiera el \"enviado especial de derechos humanos\" del Departamento de Estado norteamericano aconsejo a los productores de peliculas que mantengan tal como son las escenas difamantes a nuestra maxima dignidad  al referirse a la necesidad de molestar al gobierno norcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el hecho demuestra que EE.UU. es precisamente el caudillo del terrorismo que habla tanto de la lucha antiterrorista por doquier del mundo, mientras maniobra para producir las peliculas incitantes al terrorismo y  difundirlas en varios paises del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos demuestran que el responsable del presente incidente cae sobre la administracion norteamericana y el presidente Obama que controla generalmente la politica de su pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, ?Obama podria encubrir sus crimenes por mas que se empene por oponerse a la justicia en este mundo tan claro y disfrace la  falsedad por la verdad?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, dirigimos una mirada confiable a los actos de \"defensores de la paz\" encaminados a prevenir el terrorismo y salvaguardar la justicia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor supuesto, no sabemos todavia quienes son ellos y a que se dedican.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, preferimos considerarlos como nuestros partidarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo que aspiran la justicia y la verdad y aprecian la conciencia,  cuentan con cientos de millones de partidarios y simpatizantes, conocidos o desconocidos, quienes se han levantado en la lucha sagrada por la justa causa y contra el terrorismo y el imperialismo yanqui, caudillo de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObama declaro personalmente la \"contramedida correspondiente\" a la RPDC, lo cual es una conducta vergonzosa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo sentimos la necesidad de saber cual es la \"contramedida correspondiente\" de Obama.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los soldados y civiles coreanos nunca se quedaran asustados ante tal declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos entrado en el contraataque superintransigente nunca visto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria gran equivocacion si el blanco de este contraataque es la trivial distribuidora de peliculas. Nuestro blanco es todos los bastiones del imperialismo yanqui que dejo a toda la nacion coreana el vejemente rencor imborrable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara destruir esos bastiones, el ejercito y pueblo coreanos ya estan listos para enfrentarse contra el imperio en todos los espacios de guerra inclusive el cibernetico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro contraataque superintransigente superara  la \"contramedida correspondiente\" declarada por Obama y se ejecutara osadamente apuntando a la Casa Blanca, el Pentagono y todo el territorio norteamericano, nido del terrorismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta es la posicion invariable de nuestro ejercito y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, los combatientes de justicia como los \"defensores de la paz\", levantados en la cooperacion antiyanqui y sagrada guerra antiyanqui para defender la justicia y la conciencia de la humanidad y desmembrar a Estados Unidos, origen de todos los males y caudillo de la injusticia, afilan sus bayonetas tanto en el propio territorio norteamericano como en todos los rincones del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa justa lucha que ellos desarrollaran en escala mundial lograra brillantes exitos miles veces mas que el ataque cibernetico sobre Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una veracidad e inevitabilidad del desarrollo de la historia el que la justicia prevalece la injusticia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuienquiera desafia a la justicia sumandose al bandidesco EE.UU,  no evitara el castigo rotundo siendo objeto de golpe de la  cooperacion antiyanqui y la sagrada guerra antiyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstados Unidos debe reflexionarse de sus conductas malas que acarrearon esa desgracia, pedir disculpa ante el pueblo coreano y la humanidad mundial y no cuestionar atrevidamente a otros."
