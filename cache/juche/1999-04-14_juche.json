Koreans were also among those present.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Premier of the cabinet Hong Song Nam made a report at the meeting.  He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    April 15 when the President was born is the greatest national holiday when a new era was opened in the history of the Korean nation and a common holiday of humankind when the dawn of the era of independence was broken.   For 70 years after the President embarked on the road of the revolution in his early years, he devoted his all to the country's freedom and independence and to the people's happiness and bright future of the humankind and thus performed immortal exploits for the era, revolution, country and people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President, the father of socialist Korea, built a powerful driving force of the revolution which does not waver even in the raging wind and best socialism which the popular masses value as their life and soul.    This is his most precious revolutionary exploit.    The President performed immortal exploits for the cause of the nation and humanity for independence by dedicating himself to it throughout his life as a great thinker, statesman and revolutionary in the 20th century.  He is the eternal sage of revolution and the sun of humankind who will shine for ever in the history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    We should hold the President in high esteem as the eternal leader of our party and people and as the sun of Juche for all ages and carry out all work as he did, taking his revolutionary idea, the Juche idea, as the eternal guiding idea of the Korean revolution.    The decisive guarantee for final accomplishment of the Juche revolutionary cause is to uphold the idea and leadership of the great leader Kim Jong Il with loyalty. We should devote all our wisdom and energies to accomplishing the grandiose plan for building a powerful nation unfolded by Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    We should surely accomplish the cause of national reunification in near future by putting spurs to the movement for national reunification in conformity with the three principles of national reunification and the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation set forth by Kim Il Sung and the five-point policy of great national unity advanced by Kim Jong Il and thus realize the lifelong desire of Kim Il Sung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    We will strengthen unity and solidarity with the world progressive people and anti-imperialist independent forces, who aspire after socialism, in the idea of independence, peace and friendship in hearty response to the noble intention of the President.     We will smash the imperialists' moves for war and aggression and actively contribute to the cause of building a peaceful and independent new world. \r\n\r\n"

Ri Kon Song, 69, who is residing in Kaesong city, said  he  defected to the north in January 1951 and joined the Korean People's Army, refusing to serve in the South Korean Army , cannon fodder of the U.S. forces.   He went on to say:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While serving in the KPA,  I fought in the enemy rear and participated in the battle  for the defence of Height 1211 and Mt. Solak Battle, and on. Through which I realized the might of the KPA.   Now I am proud of having fought after voluntarily joining the People's Army.   I  of the south origin have been accorded cordial treatment as a war veteran without any discrimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Kyu Il, 70, who is residing in Wonsan city, Kangwon Province, said he had a hard time while serving in the South Korean Army  for nearly half a year.   He went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean army is a poor servant of the U.S. forces.   It was not unusual that its soldiers were killed in battlefields, having no chance of firing a bullet. Risking my life, I crossed the frontline and joined the People's Army.   I fought as a scout of the first corps of the KPA.   Now  my friends call me a \"veteran scout.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRyong Hwan Gi, 66,   in Undok county, North Hamgyong Province, said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   It is preposterous for the South Korean authorities to describe the defectors to the north as \"ROK POWs\".   I was recruited to the South Korean Army in December 1950. We retreated as far as to Kwangju from the demarcation line of Kangwon Province.   Availing myself of coming again to that line I deserted the South Korean Army and joined the People's Army early in July 1951.   As an orderly I always accompanied commanding officers and, in this course, I saw and learnt a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All defectors were unanimous in saying that there was none of them who was willing to return to South Korea from the North Korea to which they came of their own accord. \r\n  \r\n"
