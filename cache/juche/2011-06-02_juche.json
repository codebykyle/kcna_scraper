            "content": "ATCC denuncia campaña anti-RPDC de Japón\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 2 de junio (ATCC) -- El gobierno japonés intensifica la campaña anti-República Popular Democrática de Corea en el tema de secuestro.\n\t\t\t\t\tDecidió incluir este problema en el contenido didáctico de todas las escuelas. El gobernante supremo pide a otros países la colaboración en la solución del \"problema de secuestro\" diciendo que su país lo antepone en DDHH y que este problema es lo fundamental en las relaciones Corea-Japón.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es método astuto connatural de Japón, enano político, que intenta lograr su malsano objetivo político. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapón es el país criminal de DDHH y de guerra que tanto en el punto de vista moral como en lo jurídico no tiene ninguna calificación de presentar a la RPDC el \"problema de secuestro\" y el de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha que se ha cambiado el siglo, el país isleño no hace indemnización por sus crímenes de esclavitud del tiempo pasado en que arrestó y secuestró de manera forzada a incontables coreanos incluso 200 mil mujeres y les obligó la vida de esclavos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta criminalidad debe ser castigada incondicionalmente según el \"pacto sobre la no prescripción de los crímenes de guerra y otros antihumanos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el país isleño practica la educación en el \"problema de secuestro\" inculcando a las generaciones venideras la hostilidad a la RPDC a fin de encubrir sus crímenes de lesa humanidad cometidos en el pasado, evadir la liquidación de tal criminalidad, agravar la confrontación con Corea y mantener el poder. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse método grosero vino manteniéndose por los gobernantes sucesivos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTanto en el período del poder del Partido Democrático Liberal acaudillado por Abe como en el actual poder del Partido Democrático, Japón pretende de tal manera convertir su país en el país normal liberado de la responsabilidad moral por su pasado criminal y evadir la crisis política en el interior del país. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad en que crece cada día más la demanda de sociedad internacional de promover la paz y la desnuclearización de la Península Coreana, las autoridades japonesas intentan aprovecharlo a su intriga de \"secuestro\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos países interesados dicen con precaución que Japón intenta sobreponer el \"problema de secuestro\" a las \"medidas previas para la reanudación de las conversaciones a 6 bandas\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el \"problema de secuestro\" es método tan viejo para ganar algo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCitamos por ejemplo el problema de Megumi Yokoda, que las autoridades japonesas presentan como lo principal de la solución del \"problema de secuestro\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya trascendidos, el llamado delegado de una entidad surcoreana anti-RPDC, quien se había relacionado profundamente en ese problema, dijo en agosto de 2006 que el gobierno japonés conoce bien la muerte de Megumi, pero lo \"aprovecha políticamente como un medio para ejercer presión sobre la RPDC\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sociedad japonesa también la TV Asahi transmitió en mayo de 2009 que la cancillería conoce que Megumi no está viva, noticia que armó un gran escándalo en el interior y el exterior del país. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor tales métodos y complots tan groseros y villanos, Japón se considera como enano político en la palestra internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara liberarse de esta situación, debe reflexionarse con sinceridad de su pasado criminal y liquidarlo correctamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es el problema fundamental y primordial en las relaciones Corea-Japón."

Y hemos aconsejado a las autoridades surcoreanas que se encontraban en el dilema por el fracaso total de su política de confrontación fratricida a reflexionarse de sus crímenes cometidos y les dimos varias veces la oportunidad de hacerlo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, ella respondió con maldad a la buena voluntad de la parte Norte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo tenemos nada que esperar al \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak acostumbrado a la dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras, la confrontación fratricida y la dictadura fascista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se prolonga el período de mandato de esa banda conservadora, se tornarán tan agudas las relaciones íntercoreanas y la nación coreana sufrirá inevitablemente el desastre de la guerra nuclear."
