China from August 26 to 30 at the invitation of Hu JIntao, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and president of the PRC.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim

hospitality to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il had cordial meeting and talks with Hu Jintao in Changchun City on August 27.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there from the Chinese side were Ling Jihua, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, Dai Bingguo, state councilor, Wang Jiarui, head of the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee, Yang Jiechi, minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Ping, minister in charge of the National Development and Reform Commission, Chen Deming, minister of Commerce, Liu Jieyi, deputy head of the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Liu Hongcai, Chinese ambassador to the DPRK.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu Jintao warmly welcomed Kim Jong Il's China visit on behalf of the party, government and people of China and said that his visit to Jilin Province and Heilongjiang Province, where the historical roots of Sino-DPRK friendship were provided amid the common struggle against foreign aggressors, is of particular importance in boosting the traditional bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation onto a new higher stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The China visit paid by Kim Jong Il four months after his last visit in May is a clear testimony proving what great importance he attaches to the traditional DPRK-China friendship provided by the leaders of the elder generation of the two countries, Hu said, highly appreciating the devoted service rendered by Kim Jong Il for the steady development of the bilateral friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il said that he was very pleased to meet Hu Jintao four months after, expressing deep thanks to him for sparing his precious time to come to Changchun far away from the capital to kindly receive him and according cordial hospitality to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The top leaders of the two parties and the two countries informed each other of the situations in their countries and had a frank exchange of views on boosting the relations between the two parties and the two countries and on important international and regional issues of common concern in a comradely, sincere and friendly atmosphere and reached a full consensus of views.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu said that the traditional Sino-DPRK friendship is a precious treasure of the two parties and the two peoples and it is the common historic responsibility of the two sides to advance the friendship along with the times and convey it down through generations to come, reiterating the steadfast policy of the Chinese party and government to boost the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every part of the northeastern region of China is closely associated with the footprints of revolution left by President Kim Il Sung, Hu said, adding that the President not only achieved the independence of Korea through a protracted struggle but made a great contribution to the victory of the Chinese revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stronger Sino-DPRK cooperation is favorable for stepping up socialist construction in the two countries and firmly defending and promoting common interests of the two sides and regional peace, stability and prosperity, Hu said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Chinese side sincerely wishes to preserve and develop the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation together with the Korean side, Hu said, reiterating his intention to inject fresh dynamism and vitality into the traditional Sino-DPRK friendship and give momentum to the bilateral ties of good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation and develop them in depth so as to bring bigger happiness to the two countries and the two peoples and make a greater contribution to peace, stability and prosperity and development in Northeast Asia and, furthermore, the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The long-standing DPRK-China friendship will last long no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how often a generation is replaced by another as it is the friendship that stood tempest and trials of history, Kim Jong Il said, reiterating the invariable will and determination of the party and government of the DPRK to boost the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The northeastern region of China is an unforgettable area where President Kim Il Sung waged an arduous revolutionary struggle for over 20 years joining hands with the revolutionaries and people of China, drinking water in the region and breathing air there, Kim Jong Il said, adding that the President always remembered the mountains and fields of the northeastern region of China dear to him and the Chinese comrades who fought alongside him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il said that he was deeply impressed to see the northeastern region of China developing and undergoing changes with each passing day during his visit, adding that this signal turn is a clear proof of the validity and vitality of the strategy set forth by the party and government of China to develop its northeastern region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was estimated at the talks that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and the two countries have further developed in the idea of socialism after several historic meetings between the top leaders of the two countries in recent years. The talks expressed mutual support and firm solidarity with the two parties and the two countries in their struggle for socialist construction and national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu highly appreciated the positive measures taken by the DPRK to preserve the stability, develop economy and improve the standard of people's living and sincerely wished the Korean people greater successes in the cause of nation-building under the leadership of the WPK headed by General Secretary Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu also extended support to the party and people of the DPRK in their efforts to maintain the orientation of the development of socialism and the Korean comrades exploring the road of development suited to the specific conditions of the country, expressing the belief that the whole party and the country will work hard in close unity and achieve fresh successes in the struggle to build a thriving nation without fail under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il expressed his conviction that the Chinese people would steadily win fresh great victories in their historic course of strengthening the party's ability of governance, establishing a scientific outlook on development and building a harmonious society under the leadership of the CPC with Hu Jintao as general secretary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Both sides had frank and sincere exchange of views on international and regional issues of mutual concern, the situation in Northeast Asia, in particular, and reached a full consensus of views.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu Jintao hosted a grand banquet in honor of Kim Jong Il on a visit to China at the Nanhu State Guesthouse in Changchun City in the evening on August 27.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present at the banquet on invitation were Kim Yong Chun, Kim Ki Nam, Thae Jong Su, Kang Sok Ju, Jang Song Thaek, Hong Sok Hyong, Kim Yong Il, Kim Yang Gon, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Phyong Hae, Pak To Chun and other suite members and DPRK Ambassador to China Choe Pyong Gwan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were Ling Jihua, Dai Bingguo, Wang Jiarui, Yang Jiechi, Zhang Ping, Chen Deming, Liu Zhijun, minister of Railways, Liu Jieyi, Liu Hongcai, Sun Zhengcai, secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPC, Wang Yulin, governor of Jilin Province, Gao Guangbin, secretary of the Changchun City Committee of the CPC, and other leading officials from Beijing and localities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu Jintao and Kim Jong Il made speeches there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An art performance specially prepared by Chinese artistes was given in welcome of Kim Jong Il at the Nanhu State Guesthouse Theatre, Changchun on the same day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il appreciated the performance together with Hu Jintao.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He conveyed a floral basket in congratulation of the successful performance of the artistes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hu bid warm farewell to Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il visited several cities in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces of China for five days and received sincere and warm welcome from Chinese people everywhere he went.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il visited Jilin City associated with the revolutionary activities of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greeted at Jilin Railway Station by Dai Bingguo, Wang Jiarui, Liu Zhijun, Liu Hongcai, Sun Zhengcai, Chen Weigen, deputy governor of the Jilin Province, and other officials from Beijing and local areas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il met and had a friendly talk with Dai Bingguo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that Hu Jintao, attaching utmost importance to the Sino-DPRK friendship, sent him to Jilin to accord special reception to Kim Jong Il, Dai Bingguo warmly welcomed his China visit on behalf of Hu Jintao, the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council of the PRC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dai Bingguo said that General Secretary Kim Jong Il's China visit marks a historic event which recorded a shining chapter in the strengthening the Sino-DPRK friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dai noted that the Chinese people are rejoiced as over their own over many achievements made by the Korean people in the drive to accomplish the cause of building a thriving nation and various other fields under the leadership of Kim Jong Il and sincerely congratulate them on their achievements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the collective leadership including General Secretary Hu Jintao is attaching great importance to the Sino-DPRK friendship, Dai reiterated the steadfast stand of the Chinese party and government to steadily consolidate the traditional relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il, conducted by Dai Bingguo and other senior officials of Beijing and local areas, toured various places of Jilin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his visit was Jilin Yuwen Middle School where President Kim Il Sung studied from 1927 to 1929.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon arriving at the school amid the warm welcome of its teachers and students, Kim Jong Il laid a floral basket before the statue of the President at the school and paid high tribute to him before going round the interior of the school preserved to its original state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing in profound reverence precious historic relics such as a desk and a chair associated with the noble personality of the President during his school days more than 80 years ago, Kim Jong Il was overcome with deep emotion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The student chorus of the school presented to Kim Jong Il visiting it \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" and the school song in humble reverence for the President, a peerlessly great man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After

Carrying his desire with us, we have come here today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering the northeastern area of China we have felt that this area, which had been trampled down ruthlessly by the Japanese imperialists, is now vibrant with life, enjoying a splendid development in political, economic, cultural and all other fields under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the changes the area has undergone go to show that the validity and vitality of the CPC's line and policies have been proved in practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That everything is going well in China, which shares mountain and river with our country, greatly inspires our people in their effort for the cause of socialism and the reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are convinced that the northeastern area of China, including Jilin Province, will as ever make great achievements under the leadership of the CPC headed by you in the effort to build a harmoniously and comprehensive well-off socialist society, by successfully implementing the strategy of the development of the northeastern area on the basis of the viewpoint of scientific development.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the moment we entered this area, where Comrade President Kim Il Sung, together with Chinese revolutionaries of elder generation, fought bloody battles against the Japanese imperialists, even eating and sleeping under the open sky, we have been wrapped in solemn feelings, thinking of traces of blood shed by revolutionary forerunners still gleaming on the crags of Jangbaek and in the stream of Amnok, and keenly felt the valuableness of Korea-China friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his youth Comrade President Kim Il Sung fought a hard-fought struggle against the Japanese imperialists here in the northeastern area, breathing air and drinking water in China and, in those days, provided a brilliant history and excellent tradition of unbreakable Korea-China friendship together with Chinese revolutionaries of elder generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the international situation remaining complicated, it is our important historical mission to hand over to the rising generation the baton of the traditional friendship passed over by the revolutionary forerunners of the two countries as a precious asset so as to carry it forward through generations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year we fully demonstrated the solidness and might of the bilateral friendship through events of \"Year of Korea-China Friendship\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, I had significant meetings with you and other leading officials of the Chinese party and reached identity of view in lots of matters in last May, further deepening the political trust and strikingly displaying the invincibility of the bilateral friendship again to the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Steadily developing the friendship through generations is an important issue in defending peace and security in the Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an unswerving policy of our party and government to further develop through generations and centuries Korea-China friendship, which has overcome all sorts of hardship through history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will as ever make every possible effort to put this friendship on a higher level, true to the noble intention of the revolutionary forerunners of the two countries."

The white paper cited facts to prove this. It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The royal instruction of Emperor Sunjong which announced the \"annexation\" on August 29, 1910 had only royal seal used for administrative approval but no signature of the emperor. \"Royal edict\" of the Japanese king promulgated on the same day had both seal and signature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that the royal instruction had no signature of the emperor of Korea proves that Emperor Sunjong did not sign the \"treaty\" in protest against the Japanese imperialists' moves to usurp Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts go to clearly prove that the \"treaty\" fabricated by the Japanese imperialist gangsters had neither legality nor validity as it was a fraud document devoid of elementary forms as an international treaty from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disclosing Japan's persistent \"justification\" of the \"treaty\" and its reactionary nature, the white paper went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive Japanese governments and reactionary conservative politicians have denied the illegality of the \"treaty\" even today after the lapse of a century since its fabrication while running whole gamut of sheer sophism to justify the \"legality\" of the \"treaty.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's attitude and viewpoint on the \"treaty\" are that the treaty was concluded as valid one from a legal point of view at the time of its conclusion and, therefore, Japan has no legal responsibility for the colonial rule over Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese reactionaries admit their history of crimes, they cannot but assure the international community that they will not repeat such crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries consider doing so as barring them from launching reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies one of the major reasons why they deny Japan's past history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another aim sought by the Japanese authorities is to evade the legal responsibility to make reparation for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities have gone so impudent as to calculate that they can shirk the responsibility for reparation if they do not admit their history of aggression and plunder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan, a member of the international community, evades its legal responsibility and obligation for the hideous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past, it will only show in the eyes of the world people that it is a lawless state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a common duty facing not only those countries which were invaded by Japan and people of those counties who suffered from it but all other people of the world to force Japan to admit its past crimes and make reparation for them, not just an issue to be settled between Korea and Japan.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Considering that Japan's redemption of its past is not only an issue related to the victims of its aggression and Japan but an issue related to global peace and security, an issue of defending justice and principle of international law, the white paper declared that the committee would join the peace-loving people in Asia and the rest of the world, progressive juristic organizations and jurists in waging a more vigorous just struggle to force Japan to settle its past crimes."

            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's \"Three-phase Unification Proposal\" Snubbed\r\nPyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- The \"three-phase unification proposal\" spelled out by traitor Lee Myung Bak is a combination of the \"proposal for unifying the Korean community\", a separatist proposal made by traitor Roh Tae Woo decades ago, and \"no nukes, opening and 3000 dollars\", an anti-reunification and confrontational policy of the conservative regime. It is, therefore, nothing but an empty talk devoid of any feasibility as it disregarded the specific reality of the north-south relations and an unreasonable anti-reunification scenario to prevent the June 15 era of reunification from advancing and realize the wild ambition for \"unification of systems.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"peaceful community\", which the Lee group claimed to be the first phase of the above-said proposal, is peppered with hypocritical and preposterous jargons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  If durable peace is to be ensured on the Korean Peninsula, the inter-Korean relations should be improved, the DPRK and the United States should conclude a peace treaty, the U.S. forces threatening peace should quit south Korea and an end should be put to arms buildup and exercises for a war of aggression against the DPRK. This is a prerequisite to durable peace on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Lee Myung Bak group raised the \"north's dismantlement of nukes\" as a precondition for the establishment of \"peaceful community\", while turning blind eyes to this fundamental issue. This is sheer sophism which can convince no one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Similarly nonsensical is Lee's proposal for building an \"economic community\" through \"comprehensive exchange and cooperation\" between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this proposal is a sinister intention of the puppet traitor to realize his wild ambition for \"unification under liberal democracy\" when an opportunity presents itself, regarding  the inter-Koreans as ties between the two different countries and whiling time away with trade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also sheer sophism for Lee to assert that it is necessary to pull down the \"barrier of systems\" between the north and the south and head for a \"national community\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans have the proposal of founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo, the most realistic and convincing proposal for reunification based on the three principles --independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Growing stronger as the days go by are the faith and will of the Korean nation to achieve independent reunification in accordance with the proposal for founding the DFRK holding high the banner of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group's desperate efforts to realize its wild ambition for achieving \"unification of systems\" by doing harm to the DPRK in reliance upon foreign forces will get it nowhere."

   Kim Jong Il, Secretario General del  Partido del Trabajo de Corea y Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, pronuncio el siguiente discurso:\n\t\t\t\t\tEstimado camarada Secretario General Hu Jintao,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCamaradas chinos intimos,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Estoy muy contento de volver a visitar a China a menos de 4 meses cumplimentando la cordial invitacion del camarada Secretario General Hu Jintao y de sostener con el este encuentro significativo\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn primer lugar, quisiera agradecer sinceramente al camarada Secretario General Hu Jintao quien vino hasta esta provincia de Jilin, muy lejana desde Beijing, ofrecio este banquete solmene para nosotros y pronuncio el discurso cordial y amistoso que acabamos de escuchar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tambien, manifiesto el profundo agradecimiento a los cuadros del centro y de la provincia de Jilin y otros camaradas chinos quienes nos tratan cordialmente con el sentimiento fraternal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las provincias de Jilin y Heilongjiang son las tierras historicas e inolvidables para el pueblo coreano y testigos de la amistad Corea-China porque estan grabadas ahi las imborrables huellas del camarada Presidente Kim Il Sung quien libro tempranamente junto con los camaradas chinos la ensangrentada lucha revolucionaria antijaponesa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Venimos hoy teniendo el presente el deseo del Presidente quien durante su vida, no olvidaba ni por un momento el nordeste chino de mucho significado y solia decir que volveria a pisarlo sin falta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Al entrar en esta region china, pudimos constatar que hoy dia, ella, que habia sido ocupada y saqueada despiadadamente en el pasado por los imperialistas japoneses, logra hoy un desarrollo vertiginoso en todos los dominios como la politica, la economia y la cultura y avanza con mucho animo bajo la direccion del Partido Comunista de China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos estos cambios acontecidos en esta region demuestran que se manifiestan en la realidad la justeza y la vitalidad de las lineas y politicas del PCCh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El hecho de que todas las cosas marchan bien en China, colindada con nuestro pais con montes y rios en el medio, deviene gran estimulo a la lucha de nuestro pueblo por la causa socialista y la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Estamos convencidos de que bajo la direccion del PCCh encabezado por su Secretario General Hu Jintao, la provincia de Jilin y otras partes del noreste de China lograran mayores exitos en el futuro tambien en la lucha por construir una sociedad socialista armoniosa, desarrollada totalmente y acomodada elementalmente, al materializar mejor la estrategia de progresar esta region tomando como guia directriz la concepcion del desarrollo cientifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desde que entramos en la region nordeste de China donde el camarada Presidente Kim Il Sung libro la larga y ensangrentada lucha antijaponesa junto con los revolucionarios de vieja generacion de China superando todas las pruebas, recordamos con sentimiento solemne las huellas de sangre de los precursores revolucionarios, que se notan hasta ahora en cada loma Jangbaeksan y cada recoveco del rio Amnok, y sentimos en lo mas hondo del corazon cuan valiosa es la amistad Corea-China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Durante su juventud, el Presidente realizo la ensangrentada lucha antijaponesa respirando el aire y bebiendo el agua de China en esta tierra y en ese proceso, preparo la brillante historia y la excelente tradicion de la inseparable amistad Corea-China con los revolucionarios chinos de vieja generacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Bajo la compleja situacion internacional de hoy, nosotros tenemos la importantisima mision historica  de legar bien a las generaciones venideras la tradicion de la amistad Corea-China, que nos dejaron como preciosa riqueza los precursores revolucionarios de los dos paises, y de hacer que ellas la fortalezcan y desarrollen de generacion en generacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A traves del \"Ano de amistad Corea-China\" en el ano pasado, manifestamos al interior y al exterior del pais la firmeza y el poderio de la amistad entre ambos paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En particular, sostuvimos en mayo de este ano los significativos encuentros con el colectivo de direccion central incluyendo el camarada Secretario General Hu Jintao y llegamos al entendimiento comun en muchos problemas, de manera que se consolidara la confianza politica y se manifestara otra vez a todo el mundo lo inquebrantable de la amistad Corea-China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Seguir fortaleciendo de generacion en generacion la amistad Corea-China se presenta como importantisimo problema en preservar la paz y la estabilidad del Nordeste Asiatico y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El partido y el gobierno de la RPDC tienen la firme orientacion de fortalecer y desarrollar de generacion en generacion y de siglo en siglo la amistad Corea-China que supero todas las pruebas de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el futuro tambien, haremos todos los esfuerzos por fortalecer y desarrollar animadamente en el nivel mas alto la tradicional amistad Corea-China en acato al sublime proposito de los precursores revolucionarios de los dos paises."
