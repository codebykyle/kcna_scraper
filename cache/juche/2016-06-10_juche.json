            "content": "U.S. Urged to Make Bold Decision, Facing Up to Trend of Times\r\n Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The participants in the joint conference of the DPRK government, political parties and organizations sent an open letter to the United States of America on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The letter said that it is the invariable desire and wishes of the Korean people to achieve the eternal prosperity of the nation in a peaceful world and build a reunified prospering country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new line and policies for national reunification laid down at the historic Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea held recently are the historic declaration of weighty significance in settling the issue of the Korean peninsula and ensuring global peace, it noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one has a right thinking and judgment, one cannot but sympathize with the stand of the DPRK that the issue of national reunification should be settled in line with the will and wishes of the Korean nation responsible for the issue by its concerted efforts and recognize its validity, the letter said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But only the U.S., far from properly complying with the due demand of the DPRK, is persistently stemming the trend of history toward peace and reunification through its dishonest assertions and belligerent acts and also drawing its followers into its moves, the letter charged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint conference of the DPRK government, political parties and organizations held on June 9 as regards the prevailing situation decided to send an open letter to the U.S., reflecting the following principled stand of the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, the U.S. should make a bold decision to roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK which should not be pursued any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which has been pursued since its founding is a blatant challenge to the aspiration, desire and just cause of the Korean people to protect their ideology, social system, sovereignty and vital rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though belatedly, the U.S. should make a reasonable judgment for itself and make a political bold decision to valiantly root out its hostile policy toward the DPRK which was wrong from the outset and whose fatal consequences can hardly be counted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to choose a new way of thinking and opt for new practice, away from the old framework of its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK which has shackled its thinking and practice for a long period. This would be the wisest attitude which it can take and which can be welcomed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, the U.S should immediately stop arms buildup and the exercises for a war against the DPRK in south Korea, the root cause of escalating tension, and take the new road of ensuring genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not the U.S. but the DPRK, which has emerged victorious in political, military and moral terms in the confrontation that has lasted century after century and won laurels as the strong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has anxiously waited for what it called \"collapse\" while channeling all efforts into the campaign for isolating, blockading and putting military pressure on the DPRK and for provoking a war. Now it might have realized how ignorant and foolish it has been.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The way of settling an issue with a rival possessed of nuclear weapons should be shown by the U.S. itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better think twice over the lesson of history reflected in the bitter confession made by a defeated general that he fought a wrong war with a wrong rival in wrong time in wrong place and frankly accept the DPRK's just peace initiative and proposal before missing an opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the U.S. should refrain from the foolish act of meddling in the internal affairs of the Korean nation, fostering confrontation and blocking its independent reunification any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the main stumbling block in the way of settling the issue of Korea's reunification as it is stoking hostility and stand-off between the north and the south and escalating tensions by interfering in the internal affairs of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desire, wishes and demands of the Korean nation serve as the standard and yardstick for settling the issue of the destiny of the Korean nation, the matter of reunification, under any circumstances and the U.S. neither has anything to do with this nor has any right to meddle in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should give a clear answer to the Korean nation's solemn question as to whether it will be shamefully driven out of Korea after facing a stern punishment in the world's eyes or take hands off the Korean issue and quit south Korea of its own accord as befitting \"American gentleman.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should no longer stem the strong trend of the history of the nation advancing toward independence, peace, reconciliation, unity, reunification and prosperity but stop the foolish act of hurling a handful of pro-U.S. stooges into sowing seeds of discord among Koreans and fostering confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History and time will clearly prove that this warning served by the DPRK to the U.S. is by no means an empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking this opportunity, we would like to express the conviction that the fair-minded and sensible figures and people of broad strata in the U.S. would positively respond to the fair and aboveboard, peace-loving and sincere appeal of the DPRK."

EE.UU. debe tomar la decision de abandonar su politica hostil a la RPDC que no debe ser practicada por mas tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta politica, que se perdura desde la fundacion de la RPDC hasta la fecha, constituye un desafio brutal a la aspiracion, el anhelo y la causa justa del pueblo coreano para defender su idea y regimen y salvaguardar su soberania y su derecho a la existencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque sea tarde, EE.UU. debe hacer un juicio racional para si mismo y tomar una decision politica de erradicar la politica hostil a la RPDC, incorrecta desde el principio y que puede causar las consecuencias gravisimas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomar el nuevo pensamiento y nueva practica liberandose de la anacronica politica hostil a la RPDC que oprimio durante largo tiempo el pensamiento y practica de EE.UU., sera la mas el mas sabido procedimiento que puede hacer solo EE.UU. y es, digno de recibir aplausos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. EE.UU. debe cesar ahora mismo las tentativas de aumento armamentista en el Sur de Corea y los ejercicios de guerra anti-RPDC, que originan la tension de la situacion, y entrar en nueva trayectoria para garantizar la paz y la seguridad verdaderas de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es EE.UU. sino la RPDC el que salio victorioso en lo politico, militar, espiritual y moral en la confrontacion historica de siglo en siglo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio norteamericano, que ha esperado con ansiedad el \"derrumbe\" de la RPDC concentrando toda la fuerza en el aislamiento, bloqueo, aplastamiento militar y provocacion de guerra contra esta, podria entender hoy dia cuan absurdo e ignorante es el mismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mismo EE.UU. tiene que presentar el metodo de solucion a la contraparte, poseedora de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria mejor que recuerde la leccion de la historia reflejada en las palabras de un comandante norteamericano derrotado: la guerra coreana fue la cometida en un lugar inapropiado y en un tiempo inadecuado contra el rival equivocado, y que acepte de buena corazon la justa iniciativa y propuesta pacifistas de la RPDC antes de perder la oportunidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. EE.UU. no debe intervenir en los asuntos internos de la nacion coreana a fin de incitar la confrontacion y poner obstaculos ante la reunificacion independiente de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl perturbador principal de la reunificacion de Corea es EE.UU. que interviene en los asuntos internos de la nacion para instigar la hostilidad y confrontacion y agravar la tension entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa norma y la pauta para resolver el destino de la nacion coreana y la reunificacion de la patria devienen el anhelo, aspiracion y demanda de la misma nacion coreana y EE.UU. no  tiene ninguna relacion ni derecho a meterse alli.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe dar una respuesta clara a esta pregunta seria de la nacion coreana: ?se impulsara con verguenza tras ser castigado rotundamente ante todo el mundo? o ?se retirara por si mismo dejando de inmiscuirse en los asuntos coreanos, siendo \"caballero americano\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio no debe frenar mas la corriente de la historia nacional hacia la independencia, paz, reconciliacion, unidad, reunificacion y prosperidad y dejar de meter cizanas entre los connacionales y promover la confrontacion instigando a un punado de lacayos proyanquis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es una palabra vana nuestra advertencia a EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo comprobaran la historia y el tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esta oportunidad expresamos la esperanza de que las personalidades de diversos estratos y habitantes concientes y juiciosos de EE.UU. respondan al llamamiento de la RPDC de caracter imparcial, pacifista y sincero."
