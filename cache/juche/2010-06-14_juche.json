If he is interested in settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, he had better know well about its essence and history, to begin with, and behave himself from an impartial stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is neither a member nation of the IAEA nor a signatory to the NPT. It has never recognized the partial \"resolution\" of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Amano is free to let loose a spate of reckless remarks his own way only to betray his ignorance of the history of the nuclear issue on the peninsula. The said issue, in essence, surfaced because the United States shipped its nuclear weapons into south Korea and has threatened the DPRK with them for more than half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Amano, not knowing about this, vociferated about the DPRK's fulfillment of \"its commitment,\" the implementation of the Safeguards Accord and the like. This is nonsensical and such preposterous rhetoric will not work on anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for him to talk nonsense in a bid to create the impression that he is \"interested\" in the resumption of the six-party talks. The talks have not been resumed entirely due to the attitude of the U.S. and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One cannot but doubt whether Amano will properly operate an international organization as he thoughtlessly echoes what the U.S. utters, unaware of the above-said facts. He is orchestrating the charade aimed to increase pressure upon the DPRK as a mouthpiece and marionette of the U.S., seriously misinterpreting the essence and history of the above-said issue from the stance of a U.S. follower.   This behavior will only harm his position as the director-general of the IAEA and tarnish its image."
