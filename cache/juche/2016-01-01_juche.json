            "content": "Kim Jong Un's New Year Address\r\n Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, made his address on the New Year, Juche 105 (2016).\n\t\t\t\t\t The full text of the address reads:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dear comrades, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Filled with the dignity and self-respect of being victors, who have set up a shining milestone in the history of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea and our country, we are greeting the New Year 2016. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In reflection of the fervent loyalty of all the people and service personnel, I extend the noblest respect and New Year greetings to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the symbol of socialist Korea and the sun of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t My New Year greetings also go to all the service personnel and people, who are working devotedly for the prosperity of their socialist country with a firm determination to follow the road of Juche to the end together with the Party, and I wish that all the families will be filled with harmonious feelings and the happy laughter of our dear children resound more loudly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing in the New Year, I extend greetings to our compatriots in the south and abroad who are struggling to achieve national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, and to the progressive peoples and our friends in the world who aspire after independence, justice and peace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The year 2015 was a year of gigantic struggle, which is adorned with meaningful events and eye-opening successes, a year of victory and glory, in which socialist Korea fully demonstrated its prestige and might. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea as a proud and significant revolutionary event of the great Paektusan nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having turned out as one in hearty response to the Party's call, the service personnel and people waged a heroic struggle in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu and through bold army-people cooperation, thus bringing about proud labour results dedicated to the motherly Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station, Chongchongang Power Station in Tiers, Sci-Tech Complex, Mirae Scientists Street, Jangchon Vegetable Cooperative Farm and many other structures of lasting significance and beautiful socialist villages that embody the Party's ideas and policies sprang up, showing the mettle of the country which is advancing by leaps and bounds reducing ten years to one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our working class, scientists and technicians, true to the instructions of the great leaders, made a big stride in making the metallurgical industry Juche-based, built model, standard factories of the era of the knowledge-driven economy in various parts of the country and put production lines on a modern and IT footing, thus opening a new road of advance for developing the overall economy and improving the people's standard of living. The flames of the campaign to implement the Party's ideas and defend its policies have unfolded a proud reality of our indigenous plane flying in the sky and our indigenous subway train running under the ground, and rich fish and fruit harvests were gathered, their socialist flavour bringing pleasure to the people. Our sportspeople including the trustworthy women's soccer players exalted the honour of their motherland and further encouraged the militant spirit of our service personnel and people by winning gold medals in international competiti\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t ons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the large-scale events held to celebrate the Party's 70th anniversary drawing the attention of the world, we demonstrated far and wide the might of the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people around the Party and the bright future of Juche Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moving scenes unfolded on the October celebration square shook the world with power greater than that of explosion of an atomic bomb or that of the launching of an earth satellite, and clearly showed that nothing can check the dynamic advance of our Party, service personnel and people that are fighting with the single-hearted unity and arms as their ever-victorious weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year our service personnel and people warded off the danger of war facing their country and nation and safeguarded the dignity of the Republic and world peace with honour. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That we neutralized the hair-trigger situation teetering on the brink of armed conflict owing to the grave political and military provocations by the hostile forces and defended the dignity and security of our motherland from possible calamities is a brilliant victory born of the Herculean might of the great army-people unity and of the powerful Paektusan revolutionary army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What makes us look back upon last year with greater delight is that our young vanguard who are reliably carrying forward the lineage of the Juche revolution and faith demonstrated the might of the youth power without parallel in the world by means of their loyalty to the Party and heroic struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Educated and trained in the embrace of the great leaders and the Party, our young people rushed ahead along the course of the Korean revolution set by the Party, creating the charging spirit and culture of young people of the Songun era and performing laudable deeds that touched people's heartstrings. The millions of young people, fully equipped with the revolutionary ideology of the great leaders and firmly rallied behind the Party, have grown strong in ideas and faith, to become successors to the cause of the Juche revolution. This is the greatest dignity, pride and success for us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the victories and successes achieved last year are a fruition born of the heroic struggle of our people, who turned out in the general offensive for their country's prosperity with the spirit and mettle of Paektu, and a crystallization of the invaluable blood and sweat the service personnel and people dedicated to the country and the revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Spending last year seething with creation and filled with miraculous achievements together with the service personnel and people, who were burning their hearts with patriotism and loyalty, our Party witnessed with a warm feeling their beautiful spiritual world and strenuous struggle and gained greater strength and courage from their trust-filled look and sincere opinions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As there are the Party's sagacious leadership, the invincible army and the great people that absolutely support the Party and defend it unto death, we have no difficulties to be afraid of and can accomplish any great cause without fail-this is the proud conclusion of last year's struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I extend warm thanks to all the members of the Workers' Party of Korea, service personnel and people who glorified last year with heroic struggle and feats in devoted support of the cause of the Party cherishing ardent loyalty to it and faith in sure victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comrades, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year is a significant year when the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea is to be held. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The congress will proudly review the successes our Party has achieved in the revolution and construction under the wise guidance of the great leaders, and unfold an ambitious blueprint for hastening final victory for our revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should celebrate the Seventh Party Congress as a glorious meeting of victors as it will constitute a historic landmark in carrying out the cause of the Juche revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Let us usher in a golden age in building a thriving nation in this year when the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea is to be held!\"-this is the militant slogan our Party and people should uphold as they advance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Party members, service personnel and other people should turn out as one with ardent loyalty to the Party and extraordinary patriotic zeal, and demonstrate the spirit and mettle of Korea that is rushing forward towards final victory racing against time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should concentrate all our efforts on building an economic giant to bring about a fresh turn in developing the country's economy and improving the people's standard of living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to achieve breakthroughs for a turning point in building an economic giant the electric-power, coal-mining and metallurgical industries and the rail transport sector should advance dynamically in the vanguard of the general offensive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The problem of electricity should be resolved as an undertaking involving the whole Party and the whole state. The existing power stations should be kept in a good state of maintenance, bolstered up and run at full capacity to ensure maximum output of electric power. The construction of the Tanchon Power Station and other projects for boosting the country's power-generating capacity should be promoted along with the efforts to ease the strain on electricity supply by making proactive use of natural energy. All sectors and all units should wage a vigorous campaign to economize on electricity and make effective use of it. The sector of coal-mining industry should raise the fierce flames of an upsurge in production to ensure enough supply of coal for the thermal power stations and several sectors of the national economy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The state should take thoroughgoing measures to make certain that the sector of metallurgical industry receives adequate material supplies and the metallurgical factories, such as the Kim Chaek and Hwanghae iron and steel complexes, expand the successes achieved in making their production Juche-based and modern. By doing so it can increase the output of iron and steel. The rail transport sector should establish rigid discipline and increase effectiveness in organizing and controlling transport services to ensure regular operation of trains, and step up the modernization of railways. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party maintains the improvement of the people's living conditions as the most important of the numerous state affairs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crop farming, animal husbandry and fishing sectors should make innovations to effect a radical change in improving the people's standard of living. The agricultural sector should actively adopt superior strains and scientific farming methods, speed up the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy and take strict measures for each farming process, so as to carry out the cereals production plan without fail. The animal husbandry and fishing sectors, which are waging an all-out struggle in response to the Party's call, should ramp up production as soon as possible and see to it that the fish farms, vegetable greenhouses and mushroom production bases built across the country pay off. Thus they can contribute to enriching the people's diet. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The light industry sector should put its factories and enterprises on a highly modern footing, provide them with plenty of raw and other materials to keep their production going full steam and increase the number of world-famous products and commodities with a competitive edge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Construction is a yardstick and visual evidence for the strength of a country and the quality of its civilization; it constitutes a worthwhile, important undertaking for embodying our Party's people-oriented policies. The construction sector should launch a general offensive to implement the Party's construction policy and grand plan. By doing so, it should build important production facilities, educational and cultural institutions and dwelling houses on the highest possible level and at the fastest possible speed, so that they serve as standards and models of the times. In this way it can make sure that the great heyday of construction continues without letup. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the sectors of the national economy should set ambitious goals and maintain regular production by tapping every possible internal reserve and potentiality. They should also take it as an important policy-oriented requirement to improve product quality, ensure domestic production of equipment and rely on locally available raw and other materials, and make strenuous efforts to this end. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should buckle down to the campaign to restore the forests of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The urban and rural areas, workplaces and villages should be kept spick and span, and positive measures should be taken to conserve the resources of the country and prevent air, river and sea pollution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party is steadfast in its determination and will to solidify the foundations of a thriving country by dint of science and technology and, with them as the engine, achieve national prosperity. The scientific research sector should give priority to resolving the scientific and technological problems that arise in consolidating the might of the Juche-based industry, the socialist independent economy, and improving the people's standard of living, and strive to push back the frontiers of science and technology. Factories, enterprises and cooperative farms should build science and technology diffusion rooms in a splendid fashion and put their operation on a regular basis, so as to ensure that all the working people learn modern science and technology. It is also necessary to establish a social climate of resolving the problems arising in reality on the strength of science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Cabinet and other state and economic organs should decisively improve their economic planning and guidance. Leading economic officials should fully equip themselves with Party policy, work out plans of the economic work in an innovative way and give a strong push to it on the principle of developing all the sectors at an exponential speed by relying on the inexhaustible creative strength of the working people and by dint of modern science and technology. They should accurately identify the main link in the whole chain of economic development and concentrate efforts on it while revitalizing the overall economy, especially when the conditions are not favourable and many difficulties arise. They should be proactive in organizing and launching the work of establishing on a full scale our style of economic management method which embodies the Juche idea, thus giving full play to its advantages and vitality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political and military might of our Republic should be strengthened in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to cement the politico-ideological position of socialism rock-solid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should regard ideology as the driving force of the revolution and focus on the five-point education so as to train all the service personnel and people to be strong in ideas, to etch in their hearts the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, and encourage them to give free rein to their indomitable mental strength in the struggle to carry out the instructions of the great leaders and safeguard the Party's policies. Political work and frontline-style information and motivational work should be vigorously conducted to ensure that the whole country seethes with an atmosphere of heightened political enthusiasm in the lead-up to the Seventh Party Congress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Single-hearted unity is the great foundation and ever-victorious weapon for the Juche revolution. All the officials, Party members and other working people should connect their burning hearts with the garden of the offices of the Party Central Committee and share the Party's ideas, breathe the same breath as it and keep pace with it in order to travel one road forever following the Party. Party organizations and state organs should give absolute priority to the demands and interests of the people by thoroughly applying the politics of prioritizing, respecting and loving them, and take responsible care of their political integrity and material and cultural life to the end. Party organizations should take hold of public sentiments, rally the broad sections of the masses closely around the Party, and launch an intensive struggle among officials against all practices of abuse of power, bureaucratism and corruption that gnaw at and undermine our single-hearted unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The country's defence capability should be built up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this year, which marks the 20th anniversary of the movement of winning the title of O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment initiated by General Kim Jong Il, the People's Army should further develop itself into a revolutionary army of the Party in which the Party's unified command system is thoroughly established, into a steadfast army of the Party that keeps the revolutionary faith to the death, and effect a turnaround in implementing the Party's four-point line of building up the army to be formidable. By keeping it as the seed to conduct training in a real-war atmosphere and put it on a scientific and modern footing, the army should raise the fierce flames of training so that all the service personnel are prepared to be elite soldiers of modern warfare and stout fighters who are equipped with the military strategies and tactics of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the heroic fighting spirit and flawless abilities to fight an actual war. It should become a standard-bearer and shock forc\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t e of the times to make breakthroughs as intended by the Party on the major fronts where a thriving country is being built, and look for more tasks that are for the good of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officers and men of the Korean People's Internal Security Forces should smash in embryo the manoeuvrings of the class enemy and hostile elements to harm the leadership of the revolution, our socialist system and our people's lives and property, and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards should intensify combat and political training and fully prepare themselves to defend their villages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe munitions industry sector should develop defence science and technology, put the defence industry on a highly Juche-oriented, modern and scientific footing, and give full play to the revolutionary spirit of Kunja-ri, so as to develop and produce a greater number of various means of military strike of our own style that are capable of overwhelming the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should ensure that our people enjoy the highest quality of civilization on the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By raising the flames of radical improvement in education in the new century, we should renovate the conditions and environment for education and improve its quality decisively, thereby bringing up talented personnel who are knowledgeable, morally sound and physically strong. We should improve medical treatment and preventive work as required by the socialist public health system in order to protect the people's life and promote their health.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should make sports mass-based and part of daily concern to ensure that the whole country is astir with enthusiasm for sports, and radically develop the specialized sporting techniques to create new miracles of heroic Korea in international games. The sector of art and literature should brace itself to produce a larger number of contemporary masterpieces which make all the service personnel and people burn their hearts with enthusiasm for the revolution and for struggle.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should launch a strong drive to establish discipline with regard to moral ethics so as to ensure that a sound and civilized way of life prevails throughout the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the officials and working people should turn out as one in the struggle to usher in a golden age in building a thriving nation in this year when the Seventh Party Congress is to be held.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the tradition of struggle and temperament of our people to turn out with a single mind and will and continuously work miracles like moving mountains and filling up seas if it is the Party's call.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, as befits the core unit of the Juche revolution and the eldest son of the country, should support the Party's ideas and cause in the vanguard and advance holding up the torch of a new great revolutionary upsurge in building an economic giant. Agricultural workers, with the sense of responsibility that they are in the trench on the first line of the forward echelon of the campaign to defend socialism, should strive to bring about a turn in agricultural production. Intellectuals should promote the building of a thriving country by means of brilliant scientific and technological successes as required by the era of the knowledge-based economy, and become pacesetters and standard-bearers in opening the efflorescence of civilization of the age of the Workers' Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party pins a great hope on the role of young people in today's general advance. Young people, cherishing the trust of the Party that has given prominence to them as masters of the youth power, should train themselves further to be dependable pillars of the country and become artists of miracles and heroes on all the sites where a thriving nation is being built.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials should immerse themselves in the reality to inspire the masses and conduct every undertaking in a revolutionary and scientific way. They should also become true servants of the people and competent leading personnel of the revolution who make selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people with the ennobling view of life that they have nothing more to wish for even though their bodies may be scattered like the grains of sand on the road for the good of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In all fields of social life we should sustain the original features and great appearances of our society which is advancing on the strength of helping and leading one another forward and through a concerted effort.  Our target is a Juche-oriented socialist power, and the might of socialism is none other than the might of collectivism. All sectors and all units should attach primary importance to the interests of the state, the Party and the revolution, introduce the successes and experiences gained by the leading units and make leaps and bounds in the flames of collectivist competition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The principle of giving priority to self-development should be maintained in building a thriving socialist country. Worship of big countries and dependence on foreign forces is the road to national ruin; self-development alone is the road to sustaining the dignity of our country and our nation and to paving a broad avenue for the revolution and construction. With affection, trust, dignity and pride in everything of our own, we should achieve the great cause of building a thriving nation and realize the people's beautiful dreams and ideals without fail by our own efforts, technology and resources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National reunification is the most pressing and vital task facing the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year, greeting the 70th anniversary of national liberation, we appealed to all the compatriots to pool their efforts to open up a broad avenue to independent reunification, and strived for its realization. However, the anti-reunification forces that are not desirous of national reunification and improved inter-Korean relations ran amuck to realize their schemes for a war and even created a touch-and-go situation short of crossfire, causing grave apprehension at home and abroad. The south Korean authorities publicly sought to realize their goal of \"regime change\" in our country and unilateral \"unification of systems\" against the trend of inter-Korean dialogue and detente, and fanned distrust and confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year we should hold up the slogan \"Let us frustrate the challenges by the anti-reunification forces within and without and usher in a new era of independent reunification!\" and press on with the national reunification movement more vigorously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should reject foreign intervention and resolve the issues of inter-Korean relations and national reunification independently in keeping with the aspirations and demands of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the outside forces that divided our nation, and it is also none other than the United States and its followers that obstruct the reunification of our country. Notwithstanding this, the south Korean authorities are clinging to a smear campaign against the fellow countrymen in collusion with the outside forces while touring foreign countries to ask for the solution of the internal issue of our nation, the issue of its reunification. This is a betrayal of the country and nation that leaves the destiny of the nation at the mercy of the outside forces and sells out its interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issues of inter-Korean relations and national reunification should, to all intents and purposes, be resolved by the efforts of our nation in conformity with its independent will and demands, true to the principle of By Our Nation Itself. No one will or can bring our nation reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole nation should struggle resolutely against the sycophantic and treacherous manoeuvres of the anti-reunification forces to cooperate with the outside forces. The south Korean authorities should discontinue such a humiliating act as going on a tour of foreign countries touting for cooperation in resolving the internal issues of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is fundamental to realizing the country's reunification to prevent the danger of war and safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the peninsula has become the hottest spot in the world and a hotbed of nuclear war owing to the U.S. aggressive strategy for the domination of Asia and its reckless moves for a war against the DPRK.  The U.S. and south Korean war maniacs are conducting large-scale military exercises aimed at a nuclear war against the DPRK one after another every year; this is precipitating a critical situation in the Korean peninsula and throwing serious obstacles in the way of improving inter-Korean relations. Last year's August emergency showed that even a trifling, incidental conflict between the north and the south may spark a war and escalate into an all-out war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean authorities must discontinue their extremely dangerous aggressive war exercises and suspend acts of military provocation that aggravates tension in the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our consistent stand to strive with patience for peace in the peninsula and security in the region. However, if aggressors dare to provoke us, though to a slight degree, we will never tolerate it but respond resolutely with a merciless sacred war of justice, a great war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should value such agreements common to the nation as the three principles for national reunification and declarations between the north and the south, and in conformity with them, open up an avenue to improved bilateral relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These principles and declarations constitute the great reunification programme common to the nation, and all fellow countrymen wish that they are implemented as soon as possible and a radical phase opened up in reunifying the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are sincere about improving inter-Korean relations and reunifying the country peacefully, the south Korean authorities must not seek pointless confrontation of systems, but make it clear that they intend to respect and implement with sincerity the three principles for national reunification, June 15 Joint Declaration and October 4 Declaration, which crystallize the general will of the nation and whose validity has been proved in practice. They should cherish the spirit of the agreement signed last year at the inter-Korean high-level emergency contact, and desist from any act that will lead to a breach of the agreement and mar the atmosphere of dialogue. In the future, too, we will make strenuous efforts to develop inter-Korean talks and improve bilateral relations. We will also have an open-minded discussion on the reunification issue, one of the national issues, with anyone who is truly desirous of national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Korean people in the north, in the south and abroad will smash all challenges and obstructive moves by the anti-reunification forces in and out of the country and build a dignified and prosperous reunified Korea on this land without fail under the banner of By Our Nation Itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States has persisted in ignoring our just demand for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace pact to remove the danger of war, ease tension and create a peaceful environment in the Korean peninsula. Instead, it has clung to its anachronistic policy hostile towards the DPRK, escalating the tension and egging its vassal forces on to stage a \"human rights\" racket against the country. However, no plots and schemes of the enemy could break the indomitable will of our service personnel and people to firmly defend and add brilliance to our style of people-centred socialism, the base of their happy life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The challenges by the hostile forces remain uninterrupted and the situation is as tense as ever, but we will invariably advance along the road of independence, Songun and socialism under the unfurled red flag of the revolution, and make all responsible efforts to safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party and the government of our Republic will further strengthen solidarity with the peoples of the world who are opposed to aggression and war, domination and subordination, and develop relations of friendship and cooperation with all the countries that respect our national sovereignty and are friendly to us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of Juche-oriented socialism is ever-victorious, and only victory and glory is in store for us who are advancing under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us all strive for the final victory of the revolution full of confidence in victory and optimism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Greeting the hope-filled New Year, I wish the people across the country good health and happiness."

mejoramiento de la vida de la poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el empeno por materializar la idea del Partido y defender su politica, se hicieron realidad para nuestro orgullo el vuelo de aviones

ejercito-pueblo y el inagotable poderio del ejercito revolucionario Paektusan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi evocamos el ano pasado con mayor placer, se debe a nuestras vanguardias juveniles,

incrementar la produccion de los materiales de hierro y acero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl sector del transporte ferroviario le corresponde implantar una ferrea disciplina y perfeccionar la organizacion

a pasar por todos los procesos agricolas, a fin de cumplir infaliblemente el plan de la produccion cerealera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas ramas ganadera y pesquera que se estan revitalizando en respuesta al llamamiento del Partido incrementaran rapidamente la produccion y lograran efectos deseados en criaderos de peces, invernaderos de verduras y bases de produccion de hongos construidos en muchos lugares del pais, con miras a abastecer al pueblo una gran variedad de alimentos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl sector de la industria ligera le incumbe modernizar fabricas y empresas en un alto nivel, tomar medidas encaminadas al suministro de materias primas y materiales para activar la produccion y presentar muchos excelentes productos y mercancias que tengan competitividad en los mercados internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa construccion es un indice que demuestra a ojos vistas el poderio nacional y el nivel de la civilizacion, asi como una labor digna e importante dirigida a materializar la politica de nuestro Partido a favor del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el renglon de la construccion libraran una ofensiva general para realizar la orientacion y el gran proyecto de la construccion del Partido y levantaran en el nivel superior y a la maxima velocidad los importantes centros de produccion, docentes y culturales y viviendas como paradigmas y modelos de la epoca para que continue la era del gran esplendor de la construccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todos los dominios de la economia nacional trazaran metas ambiciosas y movilizaran todas las reservas internas y potencialidades para normalizar la produccion y se empenaran en elevar la calidad de los productos y fabricar o asegurar en el pais los equipos, las materias primas y los materiales, considerandolo como una importante politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el Partido, el ejercito y el pueblo intensificaran la campana de la repoblacion forestal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe tomaran medidas drasticas para mantener limpias las ciudades, los campos, los centros de trabajo y los poblados, proteger los recursos naturales y prevenir la contaminacion de la atmosfera, los rios y los mares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon firmes la determinacion y voluntad de nuestro Partido de valerse de las ciencias y la tecnologia para consolidar la base de un Estado poderoso y prospero y acelerar su construccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector de la investigacion cientifica resolveran primero los problemas cientificos y tecnicos que enfrentamos para fortalecer el poderio de la industria autoctona y la economia independiente socialista y fomentar el bienestar de los habitantes y estudiaran a fondo para abrir nuevos horizontes en la tecnologia de punta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las fabricas, empresas y granjas cooperativas prepararan bien las salas de divulgacion de las ciencias y la tecnologia y normalizaran su funcionamiento de modo que sus empleados, sea quien sea, aprendan los ultimos logros cientificos y tecnicos. Y en la sociedad se implantara un ambiente favorable para resolver con ayuda de las ciencias y la tecnologia los problemas que encaran en la realidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl Consejo de Ministros y los organismos economicos estatales les compete renovar decisivamente las operaciones y el mando.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos dirigentes del sector economico se identificaran plenamente con la politica del Partido y, en atencion al principio de lograr el rapido desarrollo de todos los renglones recurriendo a la inagotable creatividad de los trabajadores y los adelantos de las ciencias y la tecnologia, proyectaran con una vision innovadora las actividades economicas y las impulsaran con teson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas adversa que sea la situacion y grandes que sean las dificultades, tanto mas correctamente debemos encontrar la clave para el desarrollo economico, concentrar las fuerzas en ella y avivar la economia en su conjunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tarea para aplicar en todos los dominios nuestro metodo de administracion economica sustentada en la idea Juche sera impulsada activamente hasta que su superioridad y vitalidad se demuestren plenamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario fortalecer por todos los medios el poderio politico y militar de nuestra Republica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta consolidar la base politica e ideologica del socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe considerara la ideologia como motor de la revolucion y se concentrara la fuerza en la educacion en los 5 puntos para preparar a todos los militares y otros sectores del pueblo como poseedores de firme ideologia profundamente imbuidos del espiritu revolucionario, el del viento cortante del Paektu, de manera que ellos plasmen plenamente su inflexible espiritu en la ejecucion de los legados de los grandes lideres y la politica del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe intensificaran la labor politica, la propaganda y la agitacion como las que se realizan en la trinchera, de modo que predomine en todo el pais el elevado entusiasmo politico con motivo del Septimo Congreso del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa unidad monolitica es el mayor de todos los quehaceres de la revolucion del Juche y el arma que asegura victorias infalibles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los cuadros, miembros del Partido y demas trabajadores, enlazados inseparablemente con el Comite Central del Partido, pensaran, respiraran y caminaran al igual que el y seran sus eternos acompanantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las organizaciones partidistas y los organos estatales aplicaran la politica de aprecio, respeto y amor al pueblo, priorizaran sus exigencias e intereses y atenderan con responsabilidad su vida politica, material y cultural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiempre al tanto de la opinion publica, las organizaciones del Partido agruparan a las amplias masas alrededor del Partido y libraran una intensa lucha entre los cuadros para acabar con el abuso de la autoridad, el burocratismo y otras manifestaciones negativas y degradantes que carcomen y desintegran la unidad monolitica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos fortalecer la capacidad de la defensa nacional como una muralla de acero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este ano en que se acogera el 20 aniversario de la iniciativa por el gran General del Movimiento por el Titulo del Septimo Regimiento de O Jung Hup, el Ejercito Popular debe fortalecerse mas como tropas revolucionarias del Partido que tengan firmemente establecido el sistema de direccion del Partido y no renuncien los principios revolucionarios hasta el ultimo momento de la vida. Tambien se dara un gran avance en la materializacion del lineamiento del Partido sobre los cuatro puntos para el fortalecimiento del ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Ejercito Popular promovera el entrenamiento considerando como tareas principales hacer ejercicios como si se trataran de un combate, sentarlos sobre una base cientifica y moderna y, de esta manera, preparara a todos los militares como expertos en la guerra moderna y verdaderos guerreros versados en la estrategia y las tacticas militares de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il, el heroico espiritu y plena capacidad de combate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, sera abanderado y brigada de choque de la epoca para abrir brecha en las obras importantes para la construccion de un Estado poderoso y prospero, y hara muchos trabajos provechosos para el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea les compete aplastar en su estado de embrion los atentados de los enemigos de clase y los elementos hostiles contra la Direccion de la Revolucion, el regimen socialista y la vida y los bienes del pueblo. A los miembros de la Guardia Roja Obrero-Campesina y la Juvenil les corresponde intensificar ejercicios militares y politicos y perfeccionar los preparativos para la defensa de su tierra natal\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector de la industria de defensa nacional, desarrollaran las ciencias y la tecnologia, elevaran el nivel de la adecuacion de la produccion belica a las condiciones del pais, su modernizacion y fundamentacion cientifica e inventaran activamente autoctonos medios de golpe capaces de controlar a los enemigos, manifestando el espiritu revolucionario de la comuna Kunja.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos lograr que el pueblo disfrute de la mayor civilizacion en el maximo nivel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta cambiar radicalmente las condiciones y ambientes de la educacion conforme a los requerimientos de la revolucion educacional de la nueva centuria y renovar decisivamente la calidad de la docencia para formar a los talentos que poseen  ricos conocimientos, nobles virtudes y buena salud. Tambien es preciso mejorar el tratamiento y la prevencion de enfermedades y proteger y fomentar la vida y la salud de la poblacion segun las exigencias del sistema de la salud publica socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que levantar la fiebre por el deporte en todo el pais haciendo de la cultura fisica una actividad masiva y cotidiana, y lograr un desarrollo trascendental de las tecnicas deportivas para crear nuevos mitos de la Corea heroica en las competencias internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector artistico y literario crearan mayor cantidad de obras maestras de la epoca que convoquen a todos los militares y civiles a la lucha revolucionaria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imprescindible librar una campana para observar los principios y las reglas morales de modo que en toda la sociedad reine un estilo de vida sana y culta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este ano del VII Congreso del Partido, todos los funcionarios y trabajadores se movilizaran como un solo hombre para abrir una era de mayor esplendor en la construccion de un Estado poderoso y prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLograr sin cesar exitos admirables removiendo cielo y tierra, en total respuesta al llamamiento del Partido, es la tradicion de lucha de nuestro pueblo y su temperamento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa heroica clase obrera de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il asume el deber de ser la primera en defender la ideologia y la causa del Partido y levantar la antorcha del nuevo auge revolucionario en la construccion de la potencia economica en su condicion de destacamento elite de la revolucion del Juche e hijo mayor del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos agricultores, conscientes de su responsabilidad de ocupar la primera posicion en la primera linea de la defensa del socialismo, redoblaran los esfuerzos para dar avances en la produccion agricola.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos intelectuales, de conformidad con los requerimientos de la era de la economia del conocimiento, contribuiran a la construccion de un Estado poderoso y prospero con grandes exitos cientifico-tecnicos y seran vanguardias y abanderados en la tarea de alcanzar la elevada civilizacion de la epoca del Partido del Trabajo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro Partido deposita una gran confianza en el desempeno de los jovenes en la actual ofensiva general.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos, conscientes de la confianza del Partido que los presenta como protagonistas de la potencia de la juventud, se prepararan como pilares del pais y realizaran hazanas heroicas en todos los sectores de la edificacion del Estado poderoso y prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA los cuadros les corresponde ponerse en pleno contacto con la realidad, motivar a las masas, desarrollar todas las labores con metodos revolucionarios y cientificos y ser autenticos y fieles servidores del pueblo y competentes dirigentes de la revolucion que trabajan con total entrega para el pueblo a partir de la noble concepcion de que ofrendar la vida en beneficio del pueblo debe ser su mayor pretension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso promover la naturaleza y las cualidades distintivas de nuestra sociedad en que sus miembros se guian, ayudan y avanzan unidos en todos los aspectos de la vida social.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl objetivo que perseguimos es la potencia socialista del Juche y el poderio del socialismo se manifiesta precisamente por el colectivismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todos los sectores y unidades concederan la prioridad a los intereses del Estado, el Partido y la revolucion, divulgaran ampliamente los logros y experiencias de las entidades ejemplares y daran saltos mayores a un ritmo mas acelerado mediante la emulacion colectivista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario enarbolar el lema de priorizar sus propias fuerzas en la construccion de un Estado socialista poderoso y prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl servilismo y la dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras conducen al pais a la ruina y valerse de sus propias fuerzas es la unica manera de defender la dignidad de la patria y la nacion y darle curso libre a la revolucion y la construccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la confianza, el amor y el orgullo que sentimos hacia lo nuestro, lograremos la empresa de la construccion del Estado poderoso y prospero y haremos en realidad el hermoso sueno e ideal de nuestro pueblo con nuestra fuerza, tecnologia y recursos naturales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa reunificacion es la tarea mayor, mas urgente y de importancia vital para nuestra nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado en que se cumplieron los 70 anos de la liberacion nacional exhortamos a todos los compatriotas a abrir unidos un ancho camino para la reunificacion y dedicamos ingentes esfuerzos a esta tarea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las fuerzas contrarias a la reunificacion y el mejoramiento de las relaciones Norte-Sur se dedicaron con frenesi a las maniobras belicas amenazando con estallar una nueva guerra, lo cual provoco grandes inquietudes en el interior y el exterior del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas, en desafio a la tendencia a los dialogos y el mejoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas, se pronunciaron abiertamente a favor del \"cambio\" de nuestro sistema y la \"unificacion de sistemas\", agravando asi la desconfianza y el conflicto entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la consigna !Abramos una nueva era de la reunificacion independiente, frustrando los retos de las fuerzas de dentro y fuera del pais opuestas a la reintegracion!, en este ano debemos desarrollar mas energicamente el movimiento por la reunificacion nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso rechazar la intervencion de las fuerzas extranjeras y resolver el problema de la reunificacion de manera independiente y conforme al anhelo y la demanda de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra nacion fue dividida por las fuerzas extranjeras y los que impiden la reunificacion son precisamente los Estados Unidos y sus seguidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las autoridades surcoreanas traman artimanas contra sus compatriotas nortenos en confabulacion con las fuerzas extranjeras y les suplican a otros paises que resuelvan los problemas internos de la nacion como la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste es un acto propio de vendepatrias y traidores que ponen el destino de la nacion al arbitrio de las fuerzas foraneas y perjudican los intereses nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todo caso, debemos desarrollar las relaciones Norte-Sur y reunificar la patria por nuestra propia cuenta, segun el ideal de entre nosotros, los connacionales, y de acuerdo con los criterios y las exigencias de la propia nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie regala ni puede regalar la reunificacion a nuestra nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToda la nacion debe luchar resueltamente contra las maniobras de cooperacion con el extranjero de las fuerzas serviles y vendepatrias opuestas a la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas tienen que dejar de actuar de forma vergonzosa mendigando la \"cooperacion\" con otros paises para resolver los problemas internos de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConjurar el peligro de la guerra y preservar la paz y la seguridad en la Peninsula Coreana es una condicion esencial para la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy la Peninsula Coreana sigue siendo la region mas candente del planeta y el escenario de una eventual guerra nuclear debido a la estrategia agresiva de Estados Unidos de dominar toda Asia y sus insensatas maniobras belicas contra nuestra Republica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio norteamericano y los belicistas surcoreanos organizan cada ano simulacros de guerra nuclear de gran envergadura contra nuestra Republica, agravando como nunca antes la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y poniendo un gran obstaculo en el desarrollo de las relaciones Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que ocurrio entre ambas partes en agosto pasado nos ensena que hasta una contingencia aparentemente insignificante puede ser el motivo de una guerra total.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstados Unidos y las autoridades surcoreanas deben renunciar a los peligrosos ejercicios de una guerra agresiva y a las provocaciones militares que propician la tirantez de la situacion en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsforzarse con perseverancia por la paz de la Peninsula y la estabilidad de la region es nuestra actitud inalterable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, si los invasores y provocadores nos agreden en lo mas minimo, no los perdonaremos jamas y les responderemos categoricamente con una lucha despiadada pero justa y sagrada, con una guerra por la reintegracion nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso respetar los tres principios de la reunificacion de la patria, las Declaraciones Conjuntas y otros acuerdos Norte-Sur y, sobre esta base, abrir el camino para mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDichos principios y declaraciones son grandes programas para la reunificacion de la nacion coreana, y todos los compatriotas desean ponerlos en practica cuanto antes y preparar una coyuntura trascendental que favorezca la reintegracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas tienen realmente la intencion de mejorar las relaciones bilaterales y lograr de manera pacifica la reunificacion, deben dejar de promover la insensata confrontacion de sistemas y expresar su determinacion de respetar y ejecutar sinceramente los tres principios para la reunificacion de la patria, la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, documentos que sintetizan la unanime voluntad de la nacion y han confirmado su justeza en la practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades de Corea del Sur tendran en alta estima lo acordado en el contacto urgente de alto nivel del ano pasado y nunca lo contrariaran ni estropearan el ambiente de las conversaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn adelante seguiremos esforzandonos con denuedo para el avance en las conversaciones de ambas partes y la mejora de las relaciones bilaterales y discutiremos francamente sobre la reunificacion, un problema de la nacion, con todos que anhelan la reconciliacion, la unidad, la paz y la reintegracion de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los compatriotas del Norte, Sur y en el extranjero levantaran a toda costa en esta tierra una potencia reunificada, prestigiosa, poderosa y prospera, bajo la bandera de entre nosotros, los connacionales, al superar el desafio y los obstaculos de las fuerzas anti-reunificacion de dentro y fuera del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRenuente a aceptar nuestra justa propuesta de convertir el acuerdo de armisticio en el de la paz, encaminada a alejar el peligro de guerra en la Peninsula Coreana y crear un ambiente pacifico mediante la distension, Estados Unidos se ha aferrado a su anacronica politica hostil contra la RPD de Corea con el objetivo de agravar la situacion y ha instigado a sus seguidores para que se dediquen a la descabellada campana de los \"derechos humanos\" contra nuestra Republica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, con todas sus tretas y maquinaciones el enemigo no ha podido quebrantar la voluntad de nuestro Ejercito y pueblo de defender y perpetuar el socialismo a nuestro estilo centrado en las masas populares, su habitat y nido de felicidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos retos de las fuerzas hostiles y la tirantez de la situacion persisten, pero marcharemos invariablemente por el camino de la independencia, el Songun y el socialismo enarbolando la bandera roja de la revolucion y con gran sentido de responsabilidad nos esforzaremos para preservar la paz y la seguridad en la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro Partido y el Gobierno de la Republica se solidarizaran mas con los pueblos que luchan contra la agresion, la guerra, la dominacion y la subyugacion y desarrollaran las relaciones de amistad y cooperacion con todas las naciones que respetan la soberania de nuestro pais y nos tratan con amistad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa causa del socialismo del Juche sera siempre victoriosa y solamente habra victorias y gloria en nuestra marcha bajo la direccion del Partido del Trabajo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Luchemos todos resueltamente, llenos de la conviccion y el optimismo, por la victoria definitiva de la revolucion!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl celebrar el esperanzador Ano Nuevo, le deseo salud y felicidad a todo el pueblo coreano."

Por eso, este problema nunca se solucionara mientras que no se realicen estas demandas de las victimas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe reconocer su responsabilidad estatal y juridica sobre sus crimenes belicos y los otros antieticos de lesa humanidad incluyendo la esclavitud sexual, pedir disculpas y hacer indemnizacion persuasible a todas las victimas."
