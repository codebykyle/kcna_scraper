Korea Conspiracy--Rodong Sinmun\r\n Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case was consequent on the U.S. and the south Korean authorities' scheme to bring the north-south relations to collapse and escalate the tension in the Korean Peninsula and then ignite a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK major newspaper Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The persistent \"probe\" into the case made by the south Korean authorities only shows that it was the most hideous conspiratorial farce, a slush farce orchestrated by themselves, the article says, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been one year since the warship sinking case. In the period the south Korean authorities had to return to their senses and repent of their anti-reunification crime. But they use the case as a means for refusing the north-south dialogue, going against the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the inter-Korean military working-level talks opened in February, they insisted on adopting \"Responsible measures over the sinking of 'Cheonan' by an explosion and the shelling of Yonphyong Island and giving assurances against additional provocations\" as agenda of the talks, despite the magnanimity repeatedly shown by the DPRK. In this way they brought to rupture the dialogue, focus of the attention by all Koreans and the world people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though claiming that \"the door is open to dialogue,\" the south Korean authorities are still raising \"admission and apology\" over the \"Cheonan\" case and the shelling incident as a pre-condition for dialogue in a desperate attempt to oppose its resumption.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality irrefutably shows why the south Korean authorities orchestrated the \"Cheonan\" case and how they bedeviled the north-south relations and escalated the tension in the Korean Peninsula with the case as a pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Cheonan\" case is just the worst provocation unprecedented in history as it pushed the inter-Korean relations to total bankruptcy and the situation of the Peninsula to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can the south Korean authorities cover up the truth about the conspiratorial case and their treacherous crime whereby the north-south relations were brought to collapse and the Korean Peninsula fraught with danger of nuclear war."

The road of independence indicated by the Juche idea is the most correct way for every nation to achieve its maximum free development and all-round efflorescence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality in the new century proves that the Juche idea serves as one giving correct answers to the important issues related to the existence of humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disputes among nations and tribes assuming more fierce nature in the 21st century can be properly settled when they are based on the Juche idea and the Juche-oriented view on the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Juche idea serves as a banner for soundly developing the relations between countries and nations which differ in ideology, religious faith, system and culture and a powerful weapon for frustrating the moves of the imperialists to drive a wedge between nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche idea is a banner of prosperity as it helps the Korean people decorate the march of the 21st century with a great victory and exploits and make the country prosper and dynamically advance into the world and serves as life-giving water as it makes Korean-style socialism invariably shed its rays in the new century, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what long way the Korean people have to go and no matter what happens in the international arena, the Korean revolution will never deviate from its chosen road, concludes the article."

This means the leakage has gone beyond the annual limit level. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards this, experts are of the view that nuclear fuel contained in cooling water might have come through the pipes that connect reactors after being damaged inside nuclear reactors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The air and soil near the power plant were seriously contaminated with radioactive materials. As a result, the amount of radioactive substance 1.4 times the normal level of a year was detected in a single day in the area 30 km from the plant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Austrian Meteorological authorities made public the observation results that the amount of cesium-137 leaked from the above-said power plant in 3-4 days after the accident at the power plant was equivalent to 20-50 percent of what leaked from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in ten days after the accident there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The radioactive substance that leaked from Japan is steadily spreading to other countries and regions, raising a global issue.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A small amount of radioactive substance is continuously detected in the air over the northeastern part of Heilongjiang Province of China and a very small amount of it has been detected in the area of Kangwon Province of south Korea since March 23. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety on March 25 said that radioactive substance believed to have leaked from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant was found in Vienna. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the National Police Agency of Japan announced that the death toll due to the killer quake and the ensuing tsunami increased to 10 489 and that of unaccounted for is 16 621 as of 10:00 Sunday. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aftershocks rock Japan continuously. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Quake of magnitude 6.5 jolted the Tohoku area on Monday. Its epicenter was in the waters off Miyagi Prefecture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t NHK said that there were 26 aftershocks of magnitude 1.5-6.5 from 17:52 of Sunday to 15:54 of Monday."
