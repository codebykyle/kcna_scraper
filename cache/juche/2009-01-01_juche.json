            "content": "Joint New Year Editorial Issued \r\n Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun, Josoninmingun and Chongnyonjonwi Thursday issued a joint editorial titled \"Glorify this year as a year of a new revolutionary upsurge sounding the general advance.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t The following are excerpts from it:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hope-filled New Year Juche 98 (2009) that will mark a turning point in the Korean revolution and the building of a great, prosperous and powerful nation has dawned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK that has emerged victorious under the banner of Songun has entered an era of a new leap.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year Juche 97 (2008) was a year of historic turn which had written a chapter of brilliant victory in the proud 60-year annals of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Workers' Party of Korea put forward a far-reaching target to open the gate to a thriving nation in 2012 that marks the centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung by representing the requirements of the developing revolution and the aspirations of the people and aroused the whole Party, the entire army and all the people to a new general offensive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the spirit of innovation was fully displayed throughout the country and remarkable achievements that would be etched in the history of the country were made on all fronts of socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe sophisticated and seasoned leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong Il is the main source of all victories and miraculous achievements in Songun Korea. Last year, too, he stood in the van of our army and people, wisely leading their efforts to build a powerful nation, by giving full scope to his inexhaustible energy. His idea and theory that illumined radiantly the path to victory of socialism and the DPRK's prosperity were the great inspiring banner that gave the fullest play to the spiritual strength of our army and people. His ceaseless forced march of on-the-spot guidance to the army units and many parts of the country from the outset towards the end of last year was a long journey of patriotic devotion unprecedented in history. The invincibility of the socialist cause of Juche was demonstrated more convincingly in the current of the vibrant times and brilliant victories were brought about on all fronts including the politico-ideological front and the anti-imperialist military\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t front. This is a demonstration of the extraordinary leadership of Kim Jong Il, a great strategist and peerless statesman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the dignity and national power of the DPRK that made a great history under the banner of the Juche idea and Songun was fully manifested.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We fully demonstrated through the efforts to adorn the 60th anniversary of the DPRK as a grand festival of victors the invariable faith and will to add brilliance for all eternity to the nation-building exploits of Kim Il Sung who had built a strong socialist country, and bring the revolutionary cause of Juche to completion under the Songun-based leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people turned out in hearty response to the Party's militant call and made a dynamic offensive to bring about eye-opening changes in all the sectors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Technological updating was carried out in the Chollima Steel Complex and many other factories and enterprises in the flames of self-reliance and such major projects as the Ryesonggang Youth Power Station No. 1, Wonsan Youth Power Station and Nyongwon Power Station were completed to build up the technological foundation and production potential of the national economy. Taehongdan and the Migok Cooperative Farm where the Party's intention is becoming a splendid reality clearly show the bright prospects of our socialist countryside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, the capital of the revolution, was spruced up and the socialist fairyland was unfolded everywhere to change the looks of the country tremendously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the Party's guidance works of national treasure value were produced in the field of literature and the arts and spectacular achievements giving pleasure to the army and people were made in science, education and sports sectors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The New Year Juche 98 (2009) is a year of a new revolutionary surge, in which all the people should launch a general offensive in response to the Party's call to make a historic leap on all fronts in the building of a prosperous nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"The whole country and all the people, as in those years of bringing about a great Chollima upsurge after the war, should launch a general offensive dynamically, sounding the advance for opening the gate to a great, prosperous and powerful nation, united closely around the Party with one mind and purpose.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today we are at a historically important point in accomplishing the Party's revolutionary cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The efforts to open the gate to a powerful nation in 2012 that marks the centennial birth anniversary of Kim Il Sung are a worthwhile struggle to inherit the glorious history and traditions of our Party and revolution that started on Mt. Paektu and win an overall victory of Korean-style socialism by building up the national power of Songun Korea on the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An era of a new great revolutionary surge lies ahead of us. Kim Jong Il kindled the torch of a new revolutionary upsurge in Kangson, the birthplace of the Chollima Movement, on December 24 last year which will shine for ever in the history of Songun Korea. It is such a great event that has brought about a turning point in the development of our Party and revolution as that in December 1956 when Kim Il Sung set the great Chollima Movement in motion. Herein lies our Party's invariable will to build a powerful socialist country that ensures the eternal prosperity of the nation under the blue sky of our country highly dignified with Songun and hand it down to posterity by racing against the time in the spirit and the mettle of having overcome manifold difficulties and built on the war debris a strong country independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence through a great Chollima upsurge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Make the fullest development of Songun Korea by inheriting the great tradition of revolutionary upswing!\" - this is the militant slogan that we should hold up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should make a history of effecting a new surge in the 21st century by relying on our ideology and way of working and giving full play to the advantages of the independent socialist economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make a leap forward on all fronts by displaying the indomitable spiritual strength and using all the potentials to the full that we have cultivated and built in the flames of Songun - this is the general orientation we have to follow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A political and ideological offensive should be launched vigorously to demonstrate the might of ideology, our inexhaustible spiritual strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today's general offensive in the ideological sector is a great campaign to display the might of our socialist idea to maximum by imbuing the whole of society with one ideology at a new, higher level under the banner of the Juche idea and Songun idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should make redoubled efforts to arm the whole Party, the entire army and all the people with the Juche idea and Songun idea in line with the requirements of the present pulsating times. All the Party members and working people should solve all the problems arising in the revolution and construction our own way with the pride and self-confidence of having set the pace for socialist victory by dint of Songun, guided by the great ideology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-minded unity is a main dynamic of our great history of effecting an upsurge and the leader-people-united strength is more powerful than a nuclear weapon. The glorious tradition of engraving an immortal heroic epic by dint of a harmonious whole in which the leader believes in the people and the people trust in and follow their leader absolutely should be inherited firmly. Today's great surge is a struggle to safeguard Kim Jong Il, the destiny of the country, at the cost of our lives and defend and add brilliance to socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should bring about a new revolutionary upsurge under the banner of guarding the headquarters of the revolution at the cost of our lives like our forefathers who had ushered in a great Chollima era in the post-war rehabilitation shouting the slogan of defending the Party and the leader at the risk of their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe enthusiasm of our people who value the socialist motherland of Juche as their very lives and love it immensely should be displayed to the full. Our people are a strongly patriotic people who adorned the 20th century with miraculous achievements and upswings by taking ten or a hundred steps when others were taking one step; a revolutionary people who have defended socialism in the worst adversity and opened up the way to paradise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should redouble our efforts to add glory to the socialist system that is permeated with the desire of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners and the blood and sweat of heroes of the Chollima era. All the people should join the strong current of the times in high spirits and become the pacesetters in the revolutionary upsurge and patriotic fighters in the Songun era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should fully apply the mode of struggle and creation of our style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Collectivism and self-reliance are our peculiar mode of revolution and nothing is better than this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should make it an iron rule to solve all problems on the strength of the collective and by enlisting the inexhaustible wisdom and creativity of the masses. All the posts, units and fields should help and lead one another to kindle the flame of collective innovation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Self-reliance is our strength and the key to a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should always base ourselves on the socialist soil, develop our strength and open the route of advance to victory by relying on our resources, technology and the advantages of our system. At any time, in the future as well as the present era of advanced science and technology, we should constantly inherit the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. We should live and fight in the staunch spirit and self-confidence with which we have defeated any formidable enemy and performed miracles on the debris.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All potentials of the independent socialist economy should be tapped to create the speed of general advance in the Songun era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today's upsurge is a fresh general onward movement to put the economy on the stage of rapid development on the strength of the revolutionary soldier spirit and science and technology. We have still myriads of obstacles in the way, but we are sure to win victory in the general offensive for building an economic power as there are the inexhaustible creativity of all the people and the powerful Juche-oriented industry equipped with new technologies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An important task facing us in the economic construction at present is to push the effort to put production on a normal track and the modernization in close combination by taking advantage of the socialist planned economy, thus surpassing the high-water mark in production in all sectors of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should hold the preferential development of the metal industry as the main point and concentrate efforts on tapping production potentials in the key sectors of the national economy to the full.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The metal industry is the mainstay of our independent socialist economy. It is important to decisively increase the production of iron made by the Juche method and concentratedly supply electricity, fuel and raw materials to metal works, so as to make renovated production processes bring benefits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJoint innovation should be made in the fields of electric power, coal and rail transport to promote the development of the overall national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe power industry should channel efforts into running thermal power stations at full capacity and inaugurate hydroelectric power stations whose construction is under way as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The coal industry should boost production. It is necessary to strengthen material and technological foundations of rail transport and organize and guide transport scrupulously to remarkably raise the railway traffic capacity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mining industry should develop promising mines on the principle of bringing profit and the machine-building industry should boost production and accelerate modernization. The chemical industry should increase the production of basic chemical products and accelerate the gasification project at the Namhung Youth Chemical Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A radical turn should be brought about in the efforts to improve the people's living standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To relieve scarcity of food is a pressing problem. We should concentrate all efforts on hitting this year's target of grain production with the extraordinary determination to solve food problem by our own efforts in any circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should give fuller play to the vitality of the Party's policies of improving the seed, doing double cropping and boosting potato and soya bean output and promote material and technological assistance to the rural community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fishery sector should develop the production of aquatic products, the seafood cultivation and fish farming to contribute to improving the people's diet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Factories, enterprises and locally-run factories in the light industry and all other possible units should tap production potentials to sharply increase consumer goods production and improve commodity supply service to fully satisfy the people's needs for daily necessities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The housing project in Pyongyang should be pushed audaciously and a radical improvement brought about in city management. It is important to build more structures of lasting value that embody the serve-the-people spirit and that are perfect architecturally. Land development including afforestation should be carried out in a far-sighted way, so as to turn the country into a more beautiful and better place to live in.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Economic management should be improved to give full play to the advantages of the socialist planned economy. The centralized and unified guidance of the state over the economic construction should be strengthened and planning improved in line with the requirements of the developing reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is imperative to take a viewpoint regarding science and technology as the basis of economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nationwide scientific and technological forces should be concentrated on assiduously solving problems arising in strengthening the independence of the economy and stepping up modernization. Persistent efforts should be made to update production processes and the mass-based technological innovation drive conducted more briskly. Scientists and technicians should pick up projects that are conducive to national prosperity as the seed of their research and positively carry them out to lend wings to today's general advance for a surge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fullest development of socialist culture in the Songun era should be maintained.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to add shine to the spiritual and cultural treasures created in the past under the leadership of the Party in the Songun era and conduct brisk mass art activities to make the whole country seethe with the revolutionary optimism and militant spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The educational sector should better the content and methods of teaching and improve the qualification of lecturers to make great progress in the education of the younger generation and training of talents and raise the cultural and technological standard of the working people in keeping with the requirements of the IT age. Officials in the health sector should work devotedly for the promotion of the people's health and the production of basic medicine should be increased to give fuller play to the advantages of the socialist health system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to stimulate public interest in the development of sports, make sports mass-based and ensure that sportspersons register good results in every international game.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The might of Songun should be built up in every way to ensure a military guarantee for the building of a thriving socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a major requirement of the Party's Songun revolutionary line to strengthen the country's overall strength and step up the building of a thriving nation on the basis of the unrivalled military power. We should continue to put utmost efforts to building up the country's military strength in line with the requirements of the prevailing situation and the development of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army is the mainstay and powerful main force of the revolution that supports the Party's Songun leadership in the van.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All military and political work should be aimed at establishing the revolutionary command system and military discipline whereby the entire army acts as one according to the idea, intention, order and instruction of the Supreme Commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to speed up the revolutionary transformation of the entire army, ensure firmer unity between officers and men on the basis of comradeship and more closely combine military and political affairs. The KPA should take the lead in strengthening the army-people unity, the pride of Songun Korea, by holding high the slogan \"Assist the people!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pivotal and pacemaker role of the KPA should be enhanced immensely in kindling the flame of a great surge in the Songun era. The KPA should make a breakthrough in today's general offensive as befits the creators of the revolutionary soldier spirit and be a model for society in all aspects of ideology, spirit, morality and culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It takes an uncompromising stand against those who hurt our sovereignty, dignity and socialist system. Our arms charged with class awareness and hatred against the enemy would never tolerate any act of provocation of the enemy but punish it mercilessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The habit of giving priority to arms, military affairs, should be established more thoroughly in the whole of society. Great efforts should constantly be put to the development of the defence industry as required by the line of economic construction in the Songun era and everything necessary be provided for it on a preferential basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people should acquire military knowledge with sincerity and effect a fresh turn in militia buildup this year that marks the 50th anniversary of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Party organizations should further enhance their militant function and role in order to bring about a new great upsurge on all fronts of socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Party organizations at all levels should make a turning point in the Party work as in the 1970s when they effected a great surge in all fields, full of emotion and joy of having held Kim Jong Il at the top post of the Party and revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should thoroughly apply to the Party work the great achievements he made through the Songun-based leadership for nearly half a century and intensify the work to establish the Party's monolithic system of leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should develop the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement and launch ambitious information activities to make the revolutionary enthusiasm and spirit displayed during the grand Chollima advance prevail in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the officials should make thorough preparations and work out detailed plans of their units to make them advance dynamically in the van of great upsurge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working class is the maker of proud history of great leap and the main force in the building of an economic power. They should fully demonstrate again the stamina of the Korean working class who have exalted their honour as heroes who open up an era in each phenomenal period of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Workers in Kangson should show off the mettle of the vanguard in the Songun era with the revolutionary soldier spirit and Kanggye spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The theatre of the present general offensive is a living stage of the young people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should give full play to the heroic spirit of the Korean youth in every labour-consuming site including the construction site of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station, with a great ambition and ideal in the period vibrant with great surge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Youth league organizations should thoroughly prepare all the young people as the reliable youth vanguard of the Party possessed of the spirit of defending the leader with their very lives, unshakeable faith in socialism, a high sense of duty towards the future of the country and noble moral traits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Organizations of the trade union, agricultural worker's union and women's union should enhance their role decisively to ensure that all their members perform feats in the efforts for the country's prosperity like the standard-bearers in the Chollima era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The country's reunification is the unanimous aspiration of the fellow countrymen and the supreme and urgent task for the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The national reunification movement which had been advancing vigorously along with the June 15 reunification era faced a grave challenge due to the advent of the conservative authorities in south Korea last year. All the Korean people are indignant and protest at the reckless moves of the south Korean ruling forces that flatly deny the June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, grand programmes for independent reunification, restore the era of fascist dictatorship and are hell-bent on inter-Korean confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anachronistic confrontation policy of the south Korean authorities is on the verge of total failure and the anti-reunification forces are being driven into a tight corner. The aspiration and demand of the fellow countrymen cannot be the plaything of quack politicians who have turned back on the nation and nothing can check the advance of the times towards independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drift of affairs last year shows that national reunification can be accelerated only through the determined struggle against the moves of the partitionist forces inside and outside the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should reenergize the national reunification movement this year under the slogan \"Advance dynamically along the road of independent reunification under the banner of the June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, the action programme of the former, are the milestone of national reunification. We will never tolerate any slight deviation from the historic inter-Korean declarations. Whoever wants the country's reunification and national prosperity should defend and sincerely implement the declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"By our nation itself\" is the fundamental idea to be embodied in the national reunification movement. The June 15 reunification era that turned inter-Korean relations of distrust and confrontation which had persisted for over half a century into those of reconciliation and unity proves that \"By our nation itself\" is the noble spirit of loving the country and people that accelerates independent reunification, peace and prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To achieve the country's reunification, it is imperative to take a point of view giving priority to the nation and defending the interests of the nation. All the Korean people should resolutely check and foil the manoeuvres of the anti-reunification forces running counter to the trend of the times towards independent reunification, steeped in pro-U.S. sycophancy and hostility towards the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To achieve national reconciliation and unity is an urgent demand of the national reunification movement at present. Neither the development of inter-Korean relations nor the country's reunification can be expected when both sides remain hostile toward each other and the military tension is aggravated. The spirit of reconciliation and cooperation for independent reunification, peace and prosperity should prevail in the whole country and the reunification movement be promoted by the united efforts of the patriotic forces. The south Korean people, under the slogan of independence, democracy and reunification, should make more dynamic efforts to put an end to the fascist rule of the sycophantic and treacherous conservative authorities and remove the danger of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The independent foreign policy of our Republic to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and defend peace and security of Northeast Asia and the rest of the world is demonstrating its validity more fully as the days go by. Our Party and government, under the ideal of independence, peace and friendship, will develop relations with the countries friendly towards us and make a positive contribution to achieving the cause of global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present world no other country is more politically stable than our Republic whose people are all filled with a great hope, ambition and confidence about the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our cause is the cause of Kim Il Sung, the road we take is the eternal road of Juche, road of Songun, and our strength is the single-minded unity of the entire army and all the people around the leadership of the revolution. What stirs up the hearts of our generation is the historical mission to adorn with great victory of socialism of our style a-hundred-year history of Kim Il Sung's Korea shining with the Juche era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ultimate victory is in store for us as long as there are the plan for the bright future worked out by the great Party and the infinite spiritual strength of our army and people who perform miracles by turning out in hearty response to the call of the Party."

Su viaje de inspeccion, que desde principios de enero hasta fines del ano, lo llevo, sin descanso, como si estuviera en marcha forzada, a todos los rincones del pais, sin excluir los 400 kilometros del frente, fue una larga caminata de abnegacion patriotica, sin precedentes en la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el curso de esa epoca pletorica ha sido comprobada de modo mas palpable la invencibilidad de la causa socialista del Juche y se han logrado relevantes victorias en todos los frentes, sobre todo en el politico-ideologico y el militar y antiimperialista, lo cual es una prueba fehaciente de la extraordinaria capacidad directriz del querido camarada Kim Jong Il, gran estratega y politico sin igual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano transcurrido se han puesto de manifiesto ante todo el mundo la dignidad y las potencialidades de nuestra Republica, que ha venido creando una gran historia bajo la bandera de la idea Juche, bandera de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves de la lucha por hacer del aniversario 60 de la fundacion de la Republica un gran festival de triunfadores exhibimos elocuentemente nuestra firme conviccion y voluntad de hacer brillar eternamente los meritos que el gran Lider realizo al construir el poderoso e invencible pais socialista, y de coronar con victoria la causa revolucionaria del Juche bajo el liderazgo del querido General mediante el Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn respuesta al llamamiento combativo del Partido todo el pueblo se levanto con bravura para lanzarse al ataque y registro cambios asombrosos en todas las esferas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias al espiritu de apoyarse en los propios esfuerzos, se impulso con fuerza la modernizacion en el Complejo de Acero Chollima y otras muchas empresas y fabricas, se concluyeron importantes objetivos como la Central Hidroelectrica No.1 Juventud Ryesonggang, la Central Hidroelectrica Juventud de Wonsan y la Central Hidroelectrica de Nyongwon, por lo cual se han fortalecido aun mas los cimientos tecnicos de la economia nacional y sus potencialidades productivas. Taehongdan y la Granja Cooperativa de Migok, donde el proyecto del Partido esta convirtiendose en brillante realidad, muestran claramente las halaguenas perspectivas de nuestro campo socialista. Se ha remozado magnificamente Pyongyang, capital de la revolucion, y muchos lugares han adquirido aspectos agradables de signo socialista, con el resultado de que la Patria se ha cambiado tanto de su fisonomia de modo irreconocible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la direccion del Partido, en el sector del arte y literatura se han creado obras maestras de valor patrimonial, mientras en las esferas de ciencias, ensenanza y deporte se cosecharon excelentes exitos que proporcionaron inmensas alegrias a nuestro Ejercito y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl nuevo ano 2009 sera un ano de nuevo y gran auge revolucionario en que todo el pueblo, en acato al llamado del Partido, debe desplegar una ofensiva general para imprimir avances historicos en todos los frentes de la construccion de la gran potencia prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran Dirigente, camarada Kim Jong Il, dijo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t“Todo el pais, todo el pueblo, unidos firmemente en torno al Partido con una sola alma y voluntad, como hicieron en el periodo de postguerra, cuando promovian el gran auge de Chollima, tienen que desplegar con denuedo una ofensiva general, tocando la corneta a abrir las puertas a la gran potencia prospera.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy estamos al acceso de una importante linea historica en el cumplimiento de la gran obra revolucionaria del Partido. La lucha para abrir las puertas a la gran potencia prospera en el ano 2012, centesimo natalicio del gran Lider, es una lucha digna para llevar adelante con seguridad la sagrada historia y las tradiciones de nuestro Partido y revolucion iniciadas en el Monte Paektu y para alcanzar la victoria del socialismo de nuestro estilo en todas las esferas al llevar al apogeo las potencialidades de la Corea de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe ha abierto ante nosotros la epoca de un nuevo y gran auge revolucionario. El 24 de diciembre del ano pasado el estimado Kim Jong Il, como una gesta que brillara eternamente junto con la historia de la Corea del Songun, encendio la antorcha de ese auge en Kangson, donde antano naciera el Movimiento Chollima. Esto constituye un acontecimiento de especial importancia que ha dado inicio a la era de un gran viraje en el desarrollo de nuestro Partido y nuestra revolucion al igual que en diciembre de 1956 el Lider paternal dio inicio a ese gran Movimiento. El hecho refleja la firme e inconmovible voluntad de nuestro Partido de construir y entregar a las posteridades una gran potencia socialista, garante de la eterna prosperidad nacional, bajo el azul firmamento de nuestro pais, altamente dignificado por su politica de Songun, al galopar con celeridad acortando el tiempo, con ese espiritu y temple con que en el periodo posbelico, dimos un salto sobre las escombros, mediante un \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tgran ascenso de Chollima, a la altura de una potencia independiente, autosostenida y autodefensiva, sobreponiendonos a las severas dificultades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t“!Vamos a abrir una radiante epoca de prosperidad de la Corea de Songun llevando adelante la sublime tradicion del gran auge revolucionario!”, esta es la consigna combativa que hemos de enarbolar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el Partido, todo el Ejercito y todo el pueblo tienen que crear la historia de un nuevo y gran auge del siglo XXI apoyandose en nuestra ideologia y nuestro modo de lucha y poniendo en plena accion las ventajas de nuestra economia socialista independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDar saltos agigantados en todos los frentes mediante este auge empleando al maximo nuestra indoblegable potencia espiritual y las potencialidades que hemos acumulado con la bandera de Songun en alto, esto es nuestro rumbo general de lucha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que desplegar una intensa ofensiva politico-ideologica para dar salida a nuestro poder ideologico y a nuestra inagotable potencia espiritual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ofensiva general de hoy en la esfera ideologica es la encaminada a poner en pleno juego el poderio de nuestra ideologia socialista llevando a una etapa superior la identificacion ideologica de toda la sociedad bajo la bandera de la idea Juche, idea de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHemos de desenvolver con mayor vigor la labor para pertrechar con estas ideas a la totalidad del Partido, el Ejercito y el pueblo, de conformidad con la exigencia de la efervescente epoca de hoy. Todos los militantes del Partido y demas trabajadores, tomandolas como guias, deben resolver a nuestro modo todos los problemas que se presenten en el proceso revolucionario y constructivo, con el orgullo y autoestimacion de haber allanado a la delantera el camino del triunfo del socialismo valiendose del poderio del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa unidad monolitica es la principal fuerza impulsora de la historia de nuestro gran auge, y la fuerza del aglutinamiento del Lider y el pueblo en un haz es mas potente que el arma nuclear. Hemos de continuar con seguridad la relevante tradicion de haber escrito una inextinguible epopeya heroica con la identificacion completa entre el Lider y el pueblo, consistente en que el primero confia en el segundo y este sigue a aquel con una fe absoluta. El gran ascenso de hoy es un bregar para defender a riesgo de la vida al gran General, destino de nuestra Patria, y salvaguardar y hacer brillar el socialismo. Nos compete producir ese nuevo ascenso enarbolando la bandera de la defensa a ultranza de la Direccion de la Revolucion, tal como en el dificil tiempo de postguerra abrimos la gran epoca de Chollima bajo la consigna de defender al Partido y el Lider a precio de la vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que manifestar sin reservas el entusiasmo patriotico de nuestro pueblo que aprecia como su propia vida y ama ilimitadamente a la Patria socialista del Juche. El nuestro es un pueblo de fuerte espiritu patriotico que decoro el siglo XX con prodigios y saltos dando diez o cien pasos cuando otros daban uno, y un pueblo revolucionario que frente a las pesimas adversidades salvaguardo el socialismo y abrio la senda hacia el paraiso. Hemos de luchar con el animo redoblado para hacer brillar el regimen socialista impregnado del deseo de los martires revolucionarios antijaponeses y de sangre y sudor de los heroes de la epoca de Chollima. Todos deben sumarse sin vacilacion a la impetuosa corriente de la epoca actual y cubrir su vida de honor como vanguardista del gran auge revolucionario, como luchador patriotico de la epoca de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es menester implementar a cabalidad nuestro modo de lucha y creacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El colectivismo y el apoyo en las propias fuerzas son nuestros propios modos de hacer la revolucion, y para nosotros no hay otros mejores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hay que tomar como principio inexorable resolver todos los problemas apoyandose en la fuerza del colectivo y poniendo en accion la inagotable inteligencia y facultad creadora de las masas. En todos los puestos, entidades y sectores, ayudandose y guiandose unos a otros, deben avivar la llamarada de la innovacion colectiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el apoyo en nosotros mismos descansan nuestra fuerza y la llave para abrir las puertas a la gran potencia prospera. Tenemos que allanar un camino victorioso siempre poniendo firmemente los pies en nuestro habitat socialista, multiplicando nuestra propia fuerza y basandonos en nuestros recursos, nuestra tecnica y las ventajas de nuestro regimen. Debemos seguir invariablemente el espiritu revolucionario del apoyo en las propias fuerzas, tambien en el futuro, para no hablar de hoy, era de las ciencias y tecnicas de punta, no importa que pase el tiempo y cambien las generaciones. Debemos vivir y luchar con el mismo temple ferreo y espiritu de autoestimacion con que vencimos a poderosos enemigos y creamos milagros resurgiendo de entre los escombros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que crear la velocidad de la marcha general de la epoca de Songun con la movilizacion de todas las potencialidades de la economia socialista independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran auge de hoy es un nuevo movimiento de marcha general para llevar nuestra economia a una fase de vertiginoso desarrollo con el espiritu militar revolucionario y la fuerza de las ciencias y tecnicas. Aunque nos enfrentamos como siempre a multiples dificultades, es segura la victoria de nuestra ofensiva general para la construccion de una potencia economica, porque contamos con la inagotable fuerza creadora de todo el pueblo y la poderosa industria de caracter autoctono dotada de nuevas tecnologias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tarea importante que ahora tenemos por delante en la construccion economica es alcanzar decisivamente el maximo nivel de produccion en todos los sectores de la economia nacional al impulsar energicamente y en estrecha vinculacion la normalizacion y la modernizacion de la produccion apoyandonos en la superioridad de la economia socialista planificada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHemos de concentrar la fuerza en movilizar al maximo la potencialidad productiva de los principales sectores de la economia nacional asiendo como el eslabon clave el desarrollo prioritario de la industria metalurgica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta es un pilar de nuestra economia socialista independiente. Es menester aumentar decisivamente la produccion de hierro y acero por el metodo autoctono, Juche, suministrar en forma intensiva la electricidad, los combustibles y las materias primas a las fabricas metalurgicas y procurar asi que sus procesos de produccion ya reconstruidos modernamente surtan grandes efectos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa industria electrica, la hullera y el transporte ferroviario deben dar un impulso energico, mediante innovaciones solidarias, al progreso de la economia nacional en su conjunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la rama de la industria electrica deben adelantar en lo posible la inauguracion de las centrales hidroelectricas ahora en construccion, prestando atencion, a la vez, a poner en pleno funcionamiento las termoelectricas existentes. En la de la industria hullera han de incrementar vertiginosamente la produccion. Debemos aumentar considerablemente la capacidad de circulacion fortaleciendo la base material-tecnica del ferrocarril y esmerando en la organizacion y mando del transporte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las industrias de extraccion y mecanica les corresponden respectivamente explotar de manera rentable las minas promisorias y reactivar la produccion e impulsar con dinamismo la actualizacion tecnologica. A la quimica le incumbe incrementar la produccion de articulos basicos y acelerar la obra de gasificacion en Namhung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es necesario lograr avances decisivos en la lucha por mejorar la vida de la poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Resolver el problema de los alimentos es una exigencia imperiosa de nuestro tiempo. Debemos concentrar los esfuerzos en la lucha por alcanzar la meta de produccion de cereales prevista para este ano con la irrevocable decision de autoabastecernos de alimentos cueste lo que cueste. Manifestaremos a plenitud la efectividad de las orientaciones del Partido de producir una revolucion en el mejoramiento de semillas y el cultivo de papas y promover el doble cultivo y la produccion de soja, asi como reforzaremos el apoyo material y tecnico al campo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa industria pesquera debe contribuir al mejoramiento de la calidad de la vida del pueblo mediante el desarrollo de la pesca, la maricultura y la piscicultura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta incrementar en gran medida la produccion de articulos de consumo popular explotando las reservas internas en las fabricas y empresas de las industrias ligera y local y en otras unidades afines y mejorar su suministro para satisfacer las demandas de la poblacion en cuanto a los productos de primera necesidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es menester impulsar con arreglo a un plan ambicioso la construccion de viviendas en la ciudad de Pyongyang y generar una revolucion en la urbanizacion. Hay que construir mayor cantidad de obras monumentales de gusto popular y perfectas en lo arquitectonico. Se debe promover con vision al futuro la repoblacion forestal y otras tareas de mantenimiento del territorio nacional para convertir nuestro pais en un paraiso mas hermoso y agradable para la vida humana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Debemos mejorar la administracion economica para manifestar sin reservas la superioridad de la economia socialista planificada. El Estado reforzara la direccion centralizada y unificada sobre la construccion economica y actualizara la labor de planificacion de acuerdo con la realidad en desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hay que asumir la firme actitud de desarrollar la economia basandose en la ciencia y la tecnologia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Estado centrara las fuerzas cientificas y tecnicas en resolver de modo estricto y uno tras otro los problemas que se presentan para asegurar la independencia de la economia y acelerar su modernizacion. Se acelerara con vigor la modernizacion de los procesos de produccion y repromovera mas la campana masiva para las innovaciones tecnicas. A los cientificos y tecnicos les compete elegir y resolver con exito los temas de investigacion que aporten al desarrollo y la prosperidad de la Patria para darle un amplio margen a la actual marcha general dirigida a producir un gran auge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Debemos hacer florecer mas plenamente la ya prospera cultura socialista de la epoca de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la guia del Partido, tenemos que dar mas brillos en la epoca de Songun a los bienes espirituales y culturales creados anteriormente y hacer reinar en todo el pais el optimismo revolucionario y el impetu combativo mediante dinamicas actividades artisticas masivas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El sector de la educacion debe mejorar el contenido y el metodo didactico y elevar sin cesar la preparacion de los profesores para producir una revolucion en la ensenanza de las jovenes generaciones y la formacion del capital humano y llevar los niveles de conocimientos cultural-tecnicos de los trabajadores a la altura de la exigencia del tiempo de la informatica. Los trabajadores de la salud publica deben laborar con toda su dedicacion para fomentar la salud del pueblo y aumentar la produccion de medicamentos de uso masivo para evidenciar mas las ventajas del sistema socialista de salud. Hay que despertar el interes social por el desarrollo de los deportes, promover la masificacion de esa actividad y lograr que los jugadores obtengan exitos relevantes en los certamenes internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Debemos multiplicar las potencialidades de Songun para garantizar militarmente la edificacion de una gran potencia socialista prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUna de las exigencias importantes de la linea revolucionaria de Songun de nuestro Partido es fortalecer el poderio del pais en su conjunto y acelerar la construccion de la referida potencia apoyandose en la invencible capacidad militar. Debemos seguir prestando la maxima atencion al aumento del poderio militar nacional segun lo exigen la actual situacion y el desarrollo de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Ejercito Popular es el pilar y el poderoso destacamento principal de la revolucion que sigue la direccion de Songun de nuestro Partido a la delantera. Todas las actividades politicas y militares deben ser orientadas a establecer firmemente un sistema de mando revolucionario y una ferrea disciplina que permitan a todo el Ejercito actuar como un solo hombre segun la idea y voluntad, las ordenes y directivas de su querido Comandante Supremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso intensificar la formacion de todos los combatientes en la conciencia revolucionaria y estrechar la unidad entre los oficiales y los soldados y la cooperacion entre los jefes politicos y militares, basadas en la camaraderia. El Ejercito Popular debe desempenar funciones protagonicas en el fortalecimiento de la unidad militar-civil, orgullo de la Corea de Songun, enarbolando el lema de “!Ayudar al pueblo!”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos elevar en gran medida su papel medular y de vanguardia para avivar las llamas del gran auge revolucionario. El Ejercito Popular abrira el camino en la actual ofensiva general y servira como ejemplo para la sociedad en todos los aspectos como ideologia, espiritu, moral y cultura haciendo gala asi de su espiritu revolucionario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es categorica la actitud del Ejercito Popular hacia los que atentan contra nuestra soberania, dignidad y regimen socialista. Nuestro fusil cargado de la determinacion clasista y el odio a los enemigos no perdonara ninguna provocacion y la frustrara sin cuartel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que implantar firmemente el ambiente de dar importancia al arma, a los asuntos militares, en toda la sociedad. De acuerdo con las exigencias de la linea de construccion economica para la epoca del Songun, se dedicaran enormes y sostenidos esfuerzos al desarrollo de la industria de defensa nacional y se le asegurara con la mayor prioridad cuanto sea necesario. Todo el pueblo debe estudiar con ahinco los asuntos militares y registrar un nuevo cambio en el fortalecimiento de las fuerzas armadas civiles en el presente ano que cumple el aniversario 50 de la fundacion de la Guardia Roja Obrero-Campesina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara producir un nuevo y gran auge revolucionario en todos los frentes de la construccion socialista es indispensable elevar notablemente la funcion y el rol combativos de las organizaciones del Partido de todas las instancias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstas deben generar un nuevo cambio en sus trabajos como lo hicieron en la decada de 1970 cuando habian logrado un gran ascenso en todos los dominios, embriagadas de emocion y jubilo por tener al gran Dirigente, camarada Kim Jong Il, a la cabeza del Partido y la revolucion. Han de encarnar impecablemente en sus labores las inmortales proezas que ha alcanzado durante cerca de medio siglo en el proceso de la direccion mediante el Songun, y profundizar el empeno encaminado a establecer el sistema de direccion unica del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, tienen que profundizar y desarrollar mas el Movimiento por la obtencion de la bandera roja de las tres revoluciones y efectuar con vigor las labores de propaganda y agitacion, de manera que todo el pais palpite con el mismo entusiasmo y espiritu revolucionarios que en el periodo de la gran Marcha de Chollima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA todos los cuadros les corresponde planear con decision y esmero los trabajos para conducir sus respectivas unidades a avanzar con pasos firmes al frente del gran auge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa clase obrera es la protagonista de nuestra relevante historia del gran auge y el destacamento principal de combate para la construccion de una potencia economica. Le compete volver a manifestar su espiritu heroico con que se cubrio de honor como vanguardia en cada etapa trascendental de nuestra revolucion. Los obreros de Kangson mostraran el coraje como brigada de choque de la epoca de Songun, dotada del espiritu militar revolucionario y el espiritu de Kanggye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ofensiva general de hoy constituye un teatro de actividades de los jovenes. En este efervescente tiempo de gran auge, los jovenes, con un proposito e ideal de gran alcance, exhibiran plenamente su espiritu heroico como juventud coreana en todas las tareas dificiles como la obra de construccion de la Central Hidroelectrica Juventud Songun Paektusan. Las organizaciones de la Union de la Juventud deben preparar firmemente a todos sus miembros como fidedignos vanguardias del Partido, dotados del consecuente espiritu de defender a ultranza al Lider, de la inconmovible conviccion en el socialismo, del noble sentido del deber protagonico del futuro de la Patria y de inapreciables cualidades morales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hay que elevar decisivamente los papeles de los sindicatos, la Union de Trabajadores Agricolas y la Union de Mujeres de modo que todos sus miembros realicen inapreciables meritos en la lucha por la prosperidad del pais como lo hicieron las vanguardias de la epoca de Chollima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La reunificacion de la Patria es la unanime aspiracion de los coreanos y la suprema e imperiosa tarea de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl movimiento por la reintegracion nacional, que avanzaba con vigor al iniciar la epoca de reunificacion del 15 de junio, se ve enfrentado con un grave desafio a partir de la toma del poder el ano pasado por las fuerzas conservadoras en el Sur de Corea. Las insensatas maniobras de esas autoridades que en total negacion a la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, gran programa para la reunificacion independiente, y a la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre tratan de retornar al tiempo de dictadura fascista y actuan con frenesi por enconar el enfrentamiento con el Norte, provocan irreprimibles indignaciones y protestas en todos los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, la anacronica politica de enfrentamiento de las autoridades surcoreanas esta proxima al total fracaso y las fuerzas anti-reunificacion van hundiendose en un atolladero sin salida. La aspiracion y el reclamo de los compatriotas no pueden ser objeto del entretenimiento de los politicastros que han dado espalda a la nacion y con nada pueden impedir la marcha de la epoca hacia la reunificacion independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl curso de la situacion del ano pasado muestra que solo con una lucha resuelta por frustrar las maniobras de las fuerzas divisionistas del interior y exterior es posible anticipar la reintegracion nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano debemos activar aun mas el movimiento por la reunificacion bajo el lema de “!Avancemos con pasos firmes por el camino de la reunificacion independiente enarbolando la bandera de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre!”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y el programa para su ejecucion, la del 4 de Octubre, constituyen un hito de la reunificacion de la Patria. No permitiremos ningun intento que se desvie de estas Declaraciones historicas. Los que desean la reunificacion del pais y la prosperidad de la nacion deberan defenderlas y cumplirlas a conciencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" es el ideal principal que ha de materializarse en el movimiento por la reunificacion. La epoca de reunificacion del 15 de junio que ha convertido las relaciones Norte-Sur de desconfianza y enfrentamiento de mas de medio siglo en las de reconciliacion y unidad, comprueba que este ideal representa el noble espiritu de amor a la Patria y la nacion que facilita la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad. Con miras a realizar la reintegracion territorial es preciso tener, antes que nada, el criterio de dar preferencia a su nacion y defender sus intereses. Todos los compatriotas tienen que detener y frustrar resueltamente las maniobras de las fuerzas anti-reunificacion que, presas del servilismo y adoracion a los Estados Unidos y de la hostilidad hacia los compatriotas, marchan a contrapelo del curso de la epoca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLograr la reconciliacion y unidad nacionales se presenta en la actualidad como una demanda imperiosa del movimiento por la reunificacion de la Patria. En el estado de hostilidad mutua y de tirante tension militar es imposible esperar el desarrollo de las relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur y la reunificacion del pais. Hay que procurar que el territorio se desborde del animo de reconciliarse y cooperar en pro de la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad, e impulsar el movimiento a su favor con la union de las fuerzas patrioticas. La poblacion del Sur de Corea, enarbolando la consigna de la independencia, la democracia y la reunificacion, avivara con vigor las llamaradas de la lucha por acabar con la dominacion fascista de las autoridades conservadoras de caracter vendepatria y servil a las grandes potencias y por conjurar el peligro de la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el paso de los dias se patentiza con mayor claridad la justeza de la politica exterior independiente de nuestra Republica encaminada a conseguir la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y preservar la paz y la seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico y el resto del mundo. En lo adelante tambien, nuestro Partido y gobierno de la Republica, bajo el ideal de la independencia, la paz y la amistad, seguiran promoviendo las relaciones con los paises que nos tratan amistosamente y haran activos aportes a la causa de la independencia en el orbe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el mundo de hoy no hay otro pais como nuestra Republica donde esta asegurada la estabilidad politica y todos viven llenos de gran esperanza, aspiracion y conviccion en el porvenir.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nuestra es la causa del gran Lider, camarada Kim Il Sung; nuestro camino es el camino de Juche, camino de Songun, por el que seguiremos para siempre, y nuestra fuerza es la unidad monolitica de todos los militares y civiles en torno a la Direccion de la Revolucion. El corazon de nuestras generaciones se enardece con la historica mision de adornar la historia de 100 anos de la Corea de      Kim Il Sung que brilla por la Era Juche con la gran victoria del socialismo a nuestro estilo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existen el proyecto de luminoso porvenir elaborado por nuestro gran Partido y la ilimitada potencia espiritual de nuestro Ejercito y pueblo que responden al llamado del Partido movilizandose con denuedo como un solo hombre y creando prodigios, la victoria final sera nuestra."
