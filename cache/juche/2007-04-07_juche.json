But it stands out with greater urgency in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What all the fellow countrymen want today is the independent reunification of the nation. The outside forces feeling uneasy about the desire of the Koreans for independent reunification are trying by hook or by crook to stem the flow of the times and keep their domination over south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outside forces, out of their aggressive interests, are interfering in the internal affairs of the Korean nation and encroaching upon its interests. Nevertheless, the south Korean pro-U.S. forces, captive to the old bad habit of flunkeyism and reliance upon outside forces, are joining them in hostile moves against the DPRK, thus doing serious harms to the inter-Korean relations and the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today when the situation at home and abroad is developing in favor of the reunification of the country the Korean nation feels the necessity of the establishment of its Juche character more keenly than ever before. By thoroughly establishing the Juche character the Korean nation should see that the inter-Korean relations and the movement of national reunification never play into the hands of outside forces and their followers again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity of the driving force of reunification should be strengthened in the efforts to establish the Juche character and the struggle for independent reunification be intensified under the banner of independence against the U.S. so that the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the south Korean Grand National Party which persist in dependence on outside forces, bereft of the Juche character, may not strut about any longer, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He beat back the armed invasion of the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being \"the strongest\" in the world to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation. He thus earned the fame as the legendary hero of the anti-Japanese war, ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander and gifted military strategist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Ung U, great-grandfather of the President, stood in the van of the battle for sinking the U.S. aggression ship General Sherman. Grandfather Kim Po Hyon always said that a man should die on the battlefield against the enemy and willingly saw his sons and grandsons leave for the revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The heritages left by father Kim Hyong Jik were the idea \"Jiwon\" (aim high), three contingencies, the idea to obtain good comrades and two pistols. Brother Kim Chol Ju and uncle Kim Hyong Gwon were also ardent revolutionaries who dedicated their youth and lives to the struggle for the cause of national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic spirit of the Mangyongdae family has been taken over by the great Kim Jong Il who is successfully carrying forward the immortal Songun revolutionary feats performed by the President in pioneering the Korean revolution at the point of bayonet.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
