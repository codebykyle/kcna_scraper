This is reminiscent of the crisis 20 years ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t On March 12, Juche 82 (1993), the DPRK declared its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to defend its sovereignty, security and supreme interests from the increased U.S.-led imperialists' anti-DPRK moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's withdrawal from the treaty was not intended to get access to nukes, and it was a self-defensive step only to defend its right to existence by removing a pretext for military intervention on the part of the hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The positive and constructive efforts, made by the DPRK to settle the nuclear issue even after the withdrawal, led to the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. Framework Agreement in October 1994.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. sought \"collapse\" of the DPRK behind the scene. The Obama administration, which emerged after the hawkish Bush administration, followed in the footsteps of the predecessors by sticking to the new line of \"strategic patience\" and thus augmented DPRK's repulsion and resistance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear row, kicked up by the U.S., was focused on \"collapse of socialism in the DPRK\", not the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Such wild design of the U.S. could not be realized anyhow and its drag-on tactics only reinforced the DPRK's resentment as well as its retaliatory capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last 20 years of the nuclear face-off between the DPRK and U.S., woven with the latter's ceaseless military pressure and economic sanctions on the former, resulted in the DPRK's access to nukes and long-range missiles after all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's satellite launch and possession of nukes are not designed to get an acknowledgement for a member of the \"Space Club\" and \"Nuclear Club\", as claimed by the West. They are only for ensuring smooth economic development and providing a guarantee for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anti-DPRK pressures by application of double-standards, the unjust behaviors taken by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the like 20 years ago have been revived on an extension basis in the UN arena at present, and the U.S. launched the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises for a nuclear war, together with its allied forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove once again how timely and appropriate was the DPRK's choice of toughest counteraction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. one-sided hostile policy derailed the DPRK from the track of nuclear development for peaceful purposes, forcing it to develop self-defensive nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time will show with what additional retaliatory means the DPRK would drive the hostile forces into destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has no other choice but to give up its futile hostile policy towards the DPRK."

For more than 63 years since the beginning of the Korean War (1950-1953), the DPRK has been frozen out of normal relations with other international states because of a trade embargo imposed by Washington. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This illegal straightjacket has been tightened several times down through the decades with resolutions and sanctions implemented by the UN Security Council-the latest being instigated last Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe latest round of sanctions at the U.N., initiated once again by the U.S., aims to make all remaining international conduct by north Korea next to impossible. As well as complete blackout of financial transactions, north Korea's shipping and air transport are to be impounded if they do not comply with unilateral inspections at any point.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All threats of nuclear extinction made against north Korea have come from one source-the United States of America. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yet in the Orwellian world of Western governments and their dutiful news media, reality is turned upside down. Selective amnesia and selective reporting convey the public image that it is north Korea who is the aggressor and insane nuclear threat while the U.S. is the voice of reason, peace and legality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One would never guess the true nature of the conflict on the Korean Peninsula and its very real threat to global security from a reading of the Western mainstream media. All history of the Korean conflict has been whitewashed of salient facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Take just the recent history over the last months. The latest sanctions imposed on north Korea are said to be in response to the DPRK's underground nuclear bomb test on Feb. 12. But that test was carried out after the country was threatened with sanctions in January following its successful launch of a satellite into outer space in December.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What we have here is a long cycle of U.S.-led provocation and north Korean counter-provocation. But the dynamic is only ever presented as an irrational series of provocations by Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And let's remember that north Korea only embarked on its nuclear program following earlier threats of nuclear devastation by the U.S. in 1993, after which the DPRK gave notice that it was quitting the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Nuclear weapons were first introduced into the Peninsula by the Americans in 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Peninsula was partitioned at the behest of the U.S. In the newly created south Korea, the U.S. went about installing remnants of the pro-Japanese puppets and quislings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the war broke out between north and south, the U.S. mobilized its military including nuclear weapons in support of the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is estimated that many innocent people were killed by U.S. air force bombers. Every city and major town in the north was completely destroyed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since then, the Korean War has never ended technically. The people of north Korea have lived under the shadow of destruction from American nuclear bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Given the economic, political and military stranglehold that Washington maintains on north Korea it is hardly surprising that the latter has remained fiery in its Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t North Korea's insistence on having nuclear weapons and the right to use them is based on rational and even sound moral judgment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With an objective understanding of history, it is the United States which is seen to be rogue state that is a threat to global security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t North Korea's nuclear weapons are probably the only thing restraining Washington in its criminal propensity to gratuitously attack other nations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In that way, ironically, north Korea and its nuclear defenses have managed to sustain peace in East Asia in the face of relentless U.S. aggression."

inspecciono el dia 11 la unidad de defensa de la isla Wolnae, base avanzada en la zona mas candente del frente oeste cerca de la enemiga isla Paekryong.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal abrazo uno tras uno a los ninos de la unidad de defensa, quienes tomaban manos de sus madres, y se fotografio junto con ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCaminando durante largo tiempo por la senda de la unidad de defensa, se entero detalladamente de la topografia y objetos terrestres de la isla, el estado de ubicacion de las armas de fuego y la vida de los militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el puesto de vigilancia, recibio el parte del jefe de la unidad sobre la situacion de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl hacer conocimiento detallado de la disposicion de la brigada de marina no.6 del ejercito titere y los blancos en la isla Paekryong, evaluo que la unidad esta plenamente dispuesta para hacer frente a las provocaciones de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOrdeno elevar mas en el futuro la densidad de fuego y completar de continuo el proyecto sobre el encargo del deber de fuego y el uso de canones conforme al estado de los enemigos en cambio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefinio detalladamente a los comandantes de la unidad de defensa de la isla y los miembros de mando de artilleria del cuerpo no.4 del EPC el orden de ataque y la densidad de fuego para aniquilar los blancos enemigos incluyendo los puestos de radar, los radiodetectores de canones, la base de lanzamiento Harpoon y las companias de los lanzacohetes reactivos autopropulsados de 130mm y los canones automotor de tiro parabolico de 155mm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFirmo la nueva norma de operacion maritima para hacer el imperioso tiro de advertencia cuando los buques de guerra de los enemigos acercan a la zona maritima de la linea de demarcacion militar y para hacer el fuerte fuego a punteria directa cuando ellos la invaden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo que su inspeccion a las unidades de defensa de las islas radicadas en la zona mas candente del frente suroeste es para enterarse correctamente de los preparativos de combate y definir finalmente el orden de ataque a precision a los blancos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayo que ahora los enemigos estan impacientes por los proyectiles del EPC y agrego que ellos mismos agravan la situacion practicando los ejercicios anuales en la zona mas aguda por la confrontacion entre ambas partes, pero estan tan inquietados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDestaco que si les ordena a los militares deben aniquilar a los enemigos que libran los ejercicios belicosos en esta zona muy cadente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo que en realidad, es muy alta la densidad de fuego del EPC y puede atacar 3 o 4 veces a los blancos enemigos de la isla Paekryong y convertirla en el mar de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que en los dias del combate, el jefe de la unidad de defensa tirara por si mismo la foto del campo enemigo convertido en el mar de fuego y la enviara a la Comandancia Suprema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnfatizo que si se de la orden, deben demostrar a los enemigos cual es la verdadera guerra del ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu acabando con la vida de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo encomendo durante la inspeccion a la unidad de defensa de la isla Jangjae y la unidad heroina de defensa de la isla Mu, los artilleros de la unidad de defensa de la isla Wolnae deben lanzar el primer canonazo y el cartucho de senales de la gran batalla por la reunificacion de la patria si se de la orden del Comandante Supremo, destaco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalando que la unidad acondiciono bien los puestos de combate incluyendo el puesto de vigilancia conforme al proposito de la Comandancia Suprema de hacer todos los preparativos para el enfrentamiento total, se mostro muy satisfecho de que esta es la unidad magnifica convertida en la base de ataque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la orden del Comandante Supremo otorgo directamente en el mismo lugar el titulo militar de cargo inmediatamente superior al jefe y el instructor politico de la unidad de defensa quienes convirtieron la unidad en la fortaleza inexpugnable y el buque insumergible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comandante Supremo se fotografio junto con el soldado Kim Kwang Chol quien cumplia la guardia de vigilancia y los comandantes de la unidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecorriendo el cuartel y la sala de educacion atendio la vida de los militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDio a la unidad como recuerdos binoculos y fusil automatico y se fotografio junto con los militares y las familias de los oficiales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse dia, presencio la funcion artistica de los militares de la unidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalando que los militares hicieron bien la funcion y esto es el ejemplo de la cultura del Songun y evaluo que la unidad hace bien la labor de educacion politica e ideologica conforme al proposito del partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe acompanaron en esta ocasion Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Kyok Sik, Kim Yong Chol, Pak Jong Chon, Rim Kwang Il y An Ji Yong."

Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) publico el dia 11 una declaracion como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\tA contrapelo de las repetidas advertencias de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y fuertes rechazos internos y exteriores, Estados Unidos y los belicistas surcoreanos iniciaron por fin los provocativos ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos ejercicios que se libran freneticamente en el cielo, tierra y mar del Sur de Corea junto con el simulacro \"Foal Eagle\" iniciados el pasado dia primero participan los efectivos norteamericanos, del ejercito titere surcoreano y otras fuerzas de los Estados satelites incluyendo Gran Bretana y Australia, la flota de portaaviones nuclear de EE.UU., los bombarderos estrategicos \"B-52\", los cazabombarderos tipo Stealth \"F-22\", el destructor Aegis y otros medios de ataque nuclear de tierra, aerea y mar dotados de bombas nucleares y obuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCoincidiendo con los ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC de gran envergadura, las autoridades titeres y los gangsteres del circulo militar del Sur de Corea lanzan abiertamente los disparates del llamado \"ataque a las fuerzas de mando\" y el \"foco original\" y la \"extincion del poder del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos ejercicios que se libran de modo tridimensional con la participacion de los medios de ataque nuclear de gran envergadura y las fuerzas de los Estados satelites son los juegos de guerra nuclear mas peligrosa y las acciones provocativas mas abiertas sin precedentes al juzgar su caracter,  tamano y contenido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, los belicistas norteamericanos y los titeres surcoreanos los describen como \"ejercicios anuales de defensa\" para impedir la \"provocacion y la amenaza del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl ubicar durante decenas anos los equipos de guerra nuclear en el suelo surcoreanos libran los ejercicios de guerra agresiva y hablan de los \"ejercicios anuales de defensa\", lo cual es el apogeo de desverguenza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Como pueden ser los \"ejercicios anuales  de defensa\", el simulacro de guerra nuclear de gran envergadura para el ataque preventivo a la Direccion y los puntos estrategicos y el \"derrumbe del poder de su contraparte?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs la clara declaracion de guerra contra la RPDC el que EE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos ponen en practica los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa declaramos que a partir del dia 11 de marzo en que los ejercicios de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC pasan a la etapa decisiva se invalidaria el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea, se anularian totalmente todos los acuerdos de no agresion aprobados entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea y tomaria consecutivamente la segunda y tercera contramedida mas fuerte y real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a que EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos desafian al ultimatum de la RPDC con las imprudentes maquinaciones de guerra, el Acuerdo de Armisticio y los acuerdos de no agresion, aparatos de detencion de guerra, se anularon totalmente y la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana sin mecanismo de freno capaz de detener la guerra corre al borde del estallido de la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa grave situacion de hoy muestra claramente que EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos cuestionaron obstinadamente el legal lanzamiento del satelite con fines pacificos y la justa prueba nuclear de autodefensa de la RPDC y agravaron de modo escalonado la situacion con el objetivo desatar la guerra nuclear anti-RPDC, y ellos son autores del estallido de la guerra y destructores de la paz de la Peninsula Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que los belicistas norteamericanos y surcoreanos encendieron el fuego de agresion anti-RPDC es clara la opcion de esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResponder al cuchillo con espada, al fusil con el canon y a las armas nucleares con los medios de ataque nuclear a precision al estilo coreano mas poderosos es la posicion y la respuesta invariable del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC estan llenos de la voluntad de aniquilar a los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya declaramos, todos los medios de ataque incluyendo todo el ejercito y el pueblo y los sofisticados medios de ataque nuclear ocuparon sus posiciones para el combate de ataque final por la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi disparamos todos se convertiran en el mar de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. y la banda titere  surcoreano lanzan una bala en la sagrada tierra, mar y cielo de la RPDC, el ejercito y el pueblo de esta exterminaran implacablemente los bastiones y las bases de la agresion y lograran la reunificacion de la patria, anhelo de la nacion coreana, no perdiendo jamas tal oportunidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede tolerar mas el mundo ilegal en que reinan la arbitrariedad y brutalidad de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC castigara rotundamente con los fusiles de justicia a los provocadores y agresores que se entregan a las maniobras de injusticia de toda indole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa responsabilidad de la consecuencia catastrofica que se emanen desde ahora recaera enteramente sobre EE.UU. y la banda titere surcoreana, que son provocadores."
