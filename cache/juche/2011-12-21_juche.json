Seeing his dedication in tears, the people would ask him to stop making any more journeys along snow-covered roads in cold weather and sitting up all night. Hearing this, he said he considered it as his pleasure and his routine to do so and continued his journeys despite strong wind and snow and spent nights full of enthusiasm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWho is the last laughter? No one in the world can beat the man ready to die. With such pluck and gut Kim Jong Il made trips to inspect the front and give field guidance to factories and co-op farms, providing a bright prospect for building a thriving nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK renew their determination to dynamically advance along the road of patriotism and dedication under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea, regarding the philosophy of Kim Jong Il on snow as a permanent textbook for revolution."

This reflected his iron will to carry forward the cause of national reunification of the President 100 per cent and accomplish the country's reunification the way he did.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tScientific and realistic ideas and policies for national reunification set forth by Kim Jong Il in every period and at every stage, his indefatigable enthusiasm, ardent patriotic will, indomitable spirit and outstanding leadership served as an engine that made it possible for the movement for the country's reunification  to firmly preserve its Juche-oriented character and victoriously advance despite of the U.S. imperialists' persistent moves to perpetuate the national division and to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the turn of a new century Kim Jong Il provided the historic north-south joint declaration, a milestone for the country's reunification in the 21st century. This immortal feat put the inter-Korean relations which repeated the vicious cycle of antagonism and confrontation on an orbit of harmony and reunification and also gave a strong spurs to the overall reunification movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHis ardent love for the nation and noble virtues ushered in a new epoch of the great national unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is necessary to more dynamically advance the movement for the country's reunification by carrying forward the ideas of the President and Kim Jong Il and the immortal feats performed by the peerlessly great persons. This is a sure guarantee for victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the Koreans should stage a nation-wide struggle upholding the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration as a great reunification programme and thus accomplish the historic cause of the country's reunification at any cost and translate into reality the lifelong desires of the President and Kim Jong Il for reunification without fail."
