            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Factory of KPA\r\n Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), inspected the February 20 Factory of the KPA which has turned into a model of foodstuff factories in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t In May last year when visiting the factory, he set forth the task for updating it as required by the new century and took benevolent measures for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un toured the production control room, sci-tech dissemination room, combined processing workshop and other places of the factory to learn in detail about its modernization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that a work to put all production processes of the factory on an automated, unmanned, germ-free and dust-free basis was successfully carried out, true to the intention of the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What pleased him in particular is the perfect establishment of integrated control system over production and management activities such as production of goods, quality control and administration, he said, adding that the factory is the best in the country in terms of scale and intelligent and IT level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The modernization of canned meat, bean paste and soy, butter and other production processes removed manual labor in all the processes from raw material feeding to packing, remarkably raising the productivity with less manpower. And it helped thoroughly ensure the hygienic safety of products and improve their color, flavor and quality, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The afforestation of the factory is admirable and its cultured ways in production and life has been established on a high level, he said, praising it as a model factory in the era of the WPK, a factory excellent both in interior and exterior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the factory has turned into a model for accelerating the technical updating of the country's foodstuff industry, he urged other foodstuff factories to regard it as an icon and standard one in their technical improvement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing the importance to properly set the criterion of modernization, he said that the modernization expected by the party is not the one based on other countries' efforts and technology or import of their equipment but the one depending on domestic forces and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the factory was remodeled to meet the requirements of the age of knowledge-based economy by effectively utilizing domestic sci-tech forces, he gave thanks in the name of the WPK Central Committee to the scientists and technicians of Kim Chaek University of Technology, Pyongyang University of Mechanical Engineering, Pyongyang Han Tok Su University of Light Industry, Hamhung University of Chemical Engineering and other relevant units for their positive contribution to updating the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, he went round the modernly-built cultural hall for workers at the factory and enjoyed a performance given by its art group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that he was pleased to see the modernized factory but he was more pleased to feel the ideological and moral qualities of its workers thoroughly armed with the Juche idea, he said that he got strong courage and energy while reading their mind to share their destiny with the party and hardened his belief that he could cheerfully overcome any difficulties as there is the creditable working class.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the employees of the factory as he promised during his May visit to do when it would be updated on the level expected by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Choe Ryong Hae, Hwang Pyong So, So Hong Chan, Han Kwang Sang and Ri Jae Il."

            "content": "S. Korea Accused of Pushing Inter-Korean Relations to Uncontrollable Phase of Catastrophe\r\n Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- The north-south high-level contact has failed to take place though it had been high on the agenda amid great expectation and concern of all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t This being a stark reality, the south Korean authorities are obliged to buckle down to putting the situation under control, feeling heavy remorse for it, though belatedly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, they are misleading the public opinion at home and abroad by creating the impression that the prevailing situation was created by the north's act of reneging on the bilateral agreement, bereft of elementary face. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are behaving so ridiculously as to urge the north to retract \"unreasonable preconditions\" and \"change its attitude.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a more serious attention is the fact that they are pushing the overall inter-Korean relations to a more uncontrollable phase of catastrophe, getting more frantic in their anti-DPRK confrontation racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In this connection, the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK was authorized to clarify the truth about the prevailing situation and issue a statement reiterating its principled stand internally and externally on Saturday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south high-level contact was another patriotic step taken and whose preparations were made progress thanks to the noble intention of the sagacious supreme leadership of the DPRK to turn a lane for mending the inter-Korean relations into a wide avenue and make a new history of the relations, the statement noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to this step taken into consideration of not only the present destiny of all Koreans but their future hope that the sports team of the DPRK took part in the Asian Games and a highest-level delegation of the DPRK visited Inchon on October 4, reaching a historic agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the consequent period, too, the DPRK made every sincere effort to rev up the hard-won precious atmosphere of mending the relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, opted for pushing the inter-Korean relations to a more deplorable phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Oct. 25 they began scattering leaflets hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and insulting its inviolable social system in all areas along the Military Demarcation Line including the western and central sectors of the front.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They escalated the intrusion of their naval warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK under the pretext of defending the \"northern limit line\" in the waters of the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From mid-October they began airing vulgar warning programs and recklessly firing bullets at servicepersons of the Korean People's Army on their routine patrol duty in the north's side area north of the Military Demarcation Line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities who vociferated about the mending of the inter-Korean relations and high-level contact started the large-scale Hoguk-14 drills on November 10, making a total war against the north an established fact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that they are aborting the north-south high-level contact, denying any process to mend the relations and kicking up reckless political and military confrontation rackets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the truth of the present bedeviled north-south relations for which the south Korean authorities are wholly to blame. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Policy Department of the NDC of the DPRK once again clarified a series of its principled stand in reflection of the will of its army and people enraged by the truth about the south Korean authorities' reckless behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, it is our stand that the south Korean authorities can never expect any improvement of the north-south relations and any dialogue and contact as long as they persist in their vicious anti-DPRK confrontation rackets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of south Korea uttered there is a dialogue even in the battle field. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is sheer sophism as she revealed her shameless intention to negotiate with the north while inciting distrust, hostility and confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more foolish than knocking at the door of dialogue and calling for contact while escalating the nuclear blackmail against the north by frequently introducing nuclear strike means from the U.S. into south Korea by land, sea and air. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has so far stressed more than once that war maneuvers cannot go with dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly want improved relations and dialogue, they should make a policy decision to halt the anti-DPRK leaflet scattering operations, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they do not pursue a sinister aim in their lip-service to improved relations and dialogue, they should not resort to all sorts of unjustifiable provocations on the ground and in the seas and the air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the DPRK's assertion that if they are to opt for improved relations and dialogue, they should create a corresponding atmosphere and take an attitude as a dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, it is our stand that they should boldly discard all bad habits of having reneged on the inter-Korean agreements for several generations before talking about someone's \"observation of the agreements\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean agreements are the gains common to the nation attained irrespective of ideology, social system, ideal and religious belief without exception and the historic tasks of the nation to be fulfilled without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, no one is entitled to breach all agreements of the north and the south, big and small, which they pledged to implement before the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean authorities have bedeviled the inter-Korean relations by deliberately trampling down and scrapping the hard-won bilateral agreements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the north-south high-level contact made at the outset of the year the present south Korean chief executive let her confidants agree with the north to halt slandering each other. They were so crafty as to request it to \"believe in the will of the president\" and claim that \"it would be clear if it followed the development.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities had better learn the habit of honestly fulfilling the agreements reached before paying lip-service to \"improved relations\" and \"confidence-building.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they truly want improved relations and dialogue, they should make such bold decision as abandoning the bad habit of deliberately reneging on the hard-won national agreements. This is our stance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the south Korean authorities including the present chief executive should behave in such a manner as to be helpful to the national reconciliation and unity if they truly want improved relations. This is our stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A wicked chief executive is bound to pursue an evil policy as an adage says muddy spring will have muddy streams.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous comment of the world people that they know no such wicked lady as the present south Korean chief executive. She knows nothing but letting loose reckless remarks escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen in the north wherever she goes without thinking over the consequences to be entailed by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her confrontation hysteria is accompanied by evildoings of authorities under her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the behavior of Jong Hong Won who held the post of \"prime minister\" again after being forsaken by the angered public for his ill-fame. Ryu Kil Jae, \"minister of Unification,\" is also laying bare his true colors as a despicable confrontation maniac though he uttered so many good words at the negotiating table before us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   The present chief executive of Chongwadae, before anyone else, had better stop recklessly wagging her tongue and all the south Korean authorities should halt their reckless confrontation rows if they have even an iota of sincerity for improving the north-south ties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is our principled stand and assertion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to bear deep in mind the noble intention of the supreme leadership of the DPRK to make a new history of improving the relations between the north and the south so that they may not regret later, the statement stressed."

This is the stand of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula became complicated because the U.S. has shown no will to sincerely settle the nuclear issue. The DPRK-U.S. dialogue failed to resume because of the double-dealing tactics on the part of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sincerity means honesty telling truth on the basis of respect and good will towards the other party without any bad blood or pursuance of any interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citing facts to prove that the U.S. has never remained true to its commitments and agreements with the DPRK, the commentator's article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finally, the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework has been reduced to a dead paper due to the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset it had no will to sincerely solve the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula but wasted time, waiting for socialism in the DPRK to collapse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is neither single hard-won agreement nor statement for the settlement of the nuclear issue at present which plays any function. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula remains just a dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Sincerity\" touted by the U.S. is nothing but a pretext and deceptive artifice of the criminal to evade the responsibility for totally scuttling the denuclearization of the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue can never be settled unless the U.S. deals with it with sincerity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seems to be obsessed with the daydream that it can bring the DPRK to submission by \"pursuing diplomacy backed by pressure and sanctions\". It would be well advised to face up to the reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK-U.S. relations have shifted to the ties between the two nuclear weapons states from those between the former non-nuclear state and the nuclear weapons state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK clearly  proved through three nuclear tests that it is a nuclear weapons state with diversified nuclear deterrence regardless of whether one recognizes or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are days never to return when the U.S. could unilaterally threaten and blackmail the DPRK with nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the mode of action and strong will of the DPRK to react against nukes in kind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. truly hopes for the settlement of the nuclear issue, it should completely roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and defuse its nuclear threat and give up its attempt to use nukes against the DPRK. This is the only way of settling the nuclear issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is impossible unless the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK is replaced by one friendly to it and the world is denuclearized. This is the final conclusion drawn by the DPRK from the standoff with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should pull its troops out of south Korea if it is to show the drop of its hostile policy towards the DPRK in practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. troops in south Korea are the forces implementing the hostile policy towards the DPRK and posing a nuclear threat to it and a stumbling block lying in the way of achieving peace and reunification of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out on the peninsula, the U.S. troops in south Korea will be wiped out before any others. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should stop at once the \"human rights\" racket, a vivid manifestation of its hostile policy towards the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. goes in the direction of escalating the confrontation with the DPRK, not showing any sincerity, the DPRK will be left with no option but to take tough measures against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will find it more difficult to stand in confrontation with the DPRK with the passage of time. This is a meaningful advice it would like to give to the U.S."

ejercicios militares Hoguk-14 que suponen la guerra total contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra que las autoridades surcoreanas niegan por si solas la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas y abortan el contacto de alto nivel Norte-Sur, que estaba programado ya, mediante sus demenciales actos de confrontacion politica y militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la verdad de lo que ocurre en las actuales relaciones intercoreanas debido a las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecogiendo la voluntad general de nuestro ejercito y pueblo indignados por el respecto, el Departamento de Politica del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC expone nuevamente las siguientes posiciones de principio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Primero, No deben esperar la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas, ningun dialogo o contacto, mientras continue la brutal campana conflictiva anti-RPDC de las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　La actual mandataria surcoreana dijo que hay dialogo aun en el campo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Es un sofisma que expuso la descarada voluntad de conversar con nuestra parte fomentando por otra parte la desconfianza y hostilidad y persiguiendo el enfrentamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　No habra conducta mas estupida que pedir el dialogo y el contacto recrudeciendo el chantaje nuclear contra nuestra parte con los medios de ataque nuclear de EE.UU. introducidos con frecuencia por vias terrestre, maritima y aerea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Hasta ahora, hemos reiterado muchas veces que son incompatibles los ejercicios de guerra y el dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Si quieren de veras la mejora de relaciones y el dialogo, deben tomar la decision politica de cesar el lanzamiento de volantes contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Si no hay siniestra intencion detras de la insistencia en que desean la mejora de relaciones y el dialogo, no deben incurrir en los injustificables actos provocadores de todo tipo en la tierra, el mar y el aire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Para proceder al mejoramiento de relaciones y dialogo, deben crear el ambiente conveniente y adquirir la forma de la contraparte de dialogo. Esto es nuestra posicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Segundo, Antes de exigir el \"cumplimiento de acuerdo\" de alguien, ellas deben dejar el vicio con que vinieron abortando de generacion en generacion los acuerdos N-S, he aqui nuestra posicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los acuerdos N-S, sin excepcion alguna, son las conquistas comunes de la nacion, hechas superando las diferencias de ideas, regimenes, ideales y religiones, y las tareas historicas nacionales que deben ser cumplidas sin falta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, nadie tiene derecho a violar a sus caprichos todos los acuerdos N-S, sean grandes o pequenos, firmados ante la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, las autoridades surcoreanas vienen empeorando sin parar las relaciones N-S al violar y romper a sus caprichos los valiosos acuerdos bilaterales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ellas son culpables principales que invalidan el actual acuerdo sobre el contacto de alto nivel N-S que estuvo programado ya.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el contacto de alto nivel N-S celebrado a principios de este ano, la actual mandataria surcoreana prometio, por conducto de sus inferiores, el cese de difamacion y calumnia contra la RPDC pronunciando palabras astutas como \"confien en la voluntad de presidenta\" y \"veran que es cierta mi palabra\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las autoridades surcoreanas deben aprender primero el habito de implementar los acuerdos aprobados, en lugar de abogar superficialmente por el \"mejoramiento de relaciones\" y la \"creacion de confianza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En nuestra opinion, si fueran sinceras estas palabras, deben dejar el vicio cronico de romper a sus caprichos los valiosos acuerdos nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tercero, Si es verdad el mejoramiento de relaciones aludido por las autoridades surcoreanas, todas ellas, inclusive la actual mandataria, deben actuar en la direccion de contribuir a la reconciliacion y unidad de la nacion. Esto es nuestra posicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si es malo el que gobierna, sera mala tambien su politica. Y el agua sucia de la parte arriba ensucia tambien la corriente abajo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todo el mundo coincide en que la actual mandataria surcoreana es la persona mas mala.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por cierto, ella pronuncia palabras, que buscan el enfrentamiento fratricida, en todos los lugares donde se encuentre sin meditar sus consecuencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La fiebre conflictiva de ella se manifiesta ahora en las fechorias de las autoridades inferiores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Jong Hong Won, destituido antes por el rechazo del pueblo indignado y reelegido como \"premier\" por la falta de hombres capaces en el Sur de Corea, y el ministro de Unificacion, Ryu Kil Jae, quien dijo muchas palabras agradables cuando conversaba con nuestra parte, exponen ahora cada vez mas sus atributos de maniacos de enfrentamiento con que no se puede tratar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si tienen una pizca de sinceridad en el problema de mejoramiento de relaciones N-S, la actual mandataria de Chongwadae no debe decir chismes y todas las autoridades surcoreanas han de parar sus descabellados actos conflictivos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto es la posicion de principios y la opinion de nuestra parte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para que no se arrepientan despues, las autoridades surcoreanas deben conocer bien el profundo proposito de nuestra Direccion Suprema de escribir nueva historia de mejoramiento de relaciones N-S."
