            "content": "Kim Jong Un Calls for Holding Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as General Secretary of WPK Forever\r\n Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Thursday carried \"Let Us Hold Great Comrade Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as General Secretary of Our Party Forever and Successfully Accomplish the Revolutionary Cause of Juche\", a talk the dear respected Kim Jong Un had with leading officials of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) on April 6. \n\t\t\t\t\t In the talk Kim Jong Un said that the Fourth Conference of the WPK is to be held amid great expectation and concern of the people at home and abroad in the run-up to the significant Day of the Sun marking the centenary of the birth of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un called for making the Conference serve as a turning point in providing an important landmark in upholding General Secretary Kim Jong Il as eternal leader of the WPK together with Kim Il Sung and successfully realizing their ideas and cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem as general secretary of the WPK forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Doing so is a principled requirement for holding fast to his idea and line and victoriously advancing our revolutionary cause, Kim Jong Un noted, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is by no means a symbolic meaning. This means invariably having Kim Jong Il at the post of general secretary of the WPK and carrying out the party building and activities in line his idea and intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea and line of Kim Jong Il serve as eternal guidelines of our party and revolution and an ever-victorious banner whose validity and vitality have been proven in the revolutionary practice. The victorious advance and completion of our revolutionary cause is unthinkable without his idea and line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when Kim Jong Il is held in high esteem as general secretary of the WPK forever, will it be possible to dynamically advance the revolution and construction and successfully accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche as in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the Party Conference we are going to declare internally and externally that the WPK is the glorious party of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK is the party of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as it holds them in high esteem as eternal leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The guiding idea of the WPK is the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Workers' Party of Korea is a glorious party that has Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as its guiding idea and struggles for their realization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the supreme programme of the WPK. This is a revolutionary succession to the modeling of the whole society on Kimilsungism and represents its development to a new higher stage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should wage a more dynamic struggle to model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism just as we waged a strenuous struggle under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, regarding the modeling of the whole society on Kimilsungism as the party's supreme programme.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what difficult and huge revolutionary duty we may face, we are sure to triumph as there are outstanding leaders, eternal sun of Juche, the invincible WPK, the people intensely loyal to the party and the leader as well as the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the eternal leader of our party and people and glorify his revolutionary career and undying revolutionary feats for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il was a great leader, matchless patriot and kind-hearted leader of the people, the leader who devoted his all to the prosperity of the country and the happiness of its people with absolute loyalty to the President and warm love for the country and its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His life was the most brilliant life of a peerlessly great man who performed undying feats for the party, the revolution, the country and the people true to the noble intention of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should carry out all work for holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem for all ages and perpetuating the memory of the leader with pure conscience and moral obligation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To develop the WPK into the eternal party of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il means holding fast to Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the guiding idea of the WPK and conducting the party building and activities just as was thought and intended by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is important for strengthening the WPK as the eternal party of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is to more thoroughly establish the party's monolithic leadership system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the party members, servicepersons of the People's Army and other people should uphold the party's ideology and leadership with faith and conscience, rally as firm as an iron wall around the Party Central Committee in thinking and purpose and sense of moral obligation and share their destiny with the party in good or grim days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should strengthen the single-minded unity of the WPK and the revolutionary ranks in every way and thoroughly defend it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Single-minded unity is the most valuable revolutionary legacy bequeathed to us by Kim Jong Il and mainstay of the Korean revolution. The single-minded unity in which the leader, the party and the masses are united on the basis of great idea, warm loving care and feelings is the greatest treasure more valuable than hundreds of millions of tons of gold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is essential to deeply respect the people, prioritize their interests and look after their life as their real mothers would do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Believing in the people as in Heaven was the maxim of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. True to their noble intention all the work should be conducted with priority given to the demands and interests of the people while boundlessly respecting them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to make the noble and beautiful traits of helping and leading each other forward pervade the whole country and thus make society a great harmonious family in which all its members are united in single mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The heroic deeds performed by Pak Thae Son, former miner of the Kumgol Mine, by laying down his valuable life for the collective and comrades and by Ri Chang Son who was a farmer of the Ohyon Co-op Farm of Yonan County are beautiful deeds which can be found only among the people in our era who were raised by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. They set examples for everybody to follow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun represents our independence, dignity and life. A country with weak military might can not defend its sovereignty and right to existence but will become plaything and fall victim to the imperialists in the long run. This is a hard fact. So we should consistently hold fast to the work of bolstering the military might.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The might of Songun represents the might of the People's Army and what is essential in strengthening the military might is to strengthen the People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army should become standard-bearers and a shock brigade not only in defending the country but in carrying out the party's plan for building a thriving nation as the driving force of the revolution. It should also become pace-setters in creating and disseminating Songun culture in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traits of attaching importance to military affairs should be established throughout society and an all-people, nationwide defence system should be consolidated to turn the whole country into an impregnable fortress. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should bring about a decisive turn in improving the standard of people's living and building an economic power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should put forward the people who have trusted in and followed the party only as the happiest people in the world by making the precious assets, which Kim Jong Il provided with much effort, pay off. This was his ardent wish and is the firm determination and will of our party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should wage an unflinching offensive in response to the flames of Hamnam and rapidly develop vanguard economic sectors and basic industrial fields and thus lay a firm foundation for the economic development and increase production in all domains of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Priority should be given to power, coal and metal industries and railway transport. Only then will it be possible to reenergize the national economy and stabilize and improve the people's living standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should build a knowledge-based economic power in response to the flames of the industrial revolution in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should struggle with a high aim and ideal as intended by Kim Jong Il who used to instruct to look at the world with one's feet planted on one's own land, and thus beat the world in all aspects. In the spirit of exploration and creation displayed by workers in Ryonha who brought about drastic progress in CNC machine tools production, a drive should be waged to push back the frontiers of the latest science and technology to put the country's overall technological equipment on the level of world standard and improve the economic structure to meet the requirements of the era of the knowledge-based economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Efforts should be given to land management to turn the country into a land of bliss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un called for focusing all the issues arising in the economy on the Cabinet and establishing strict discipline and order of solving them under the unified command of the Cabinet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being the headquarters responsible for the country's economy, the Cabinet should set a goal and work out strategy for economic development on a scientific and realistic basis under a long-term plan and push forward on its own initiative the work to control, guide and manage overall economic affairs in a unified manner. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All fields and units should solve all the problems related to the economic undertakings under a full agreement with the Cabinet and thoroughly carry out the Cabinet's decisions and instructions for carrying out the party's economic policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Steady revolutionary turn should be effected in all the fields of the cultural construction including education, public health, literature and arts and sports and efforts should be made to glorify our country as a developed and highly civilized socialist country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t State investment in the education should be increased and modernization of the education be realized. The level of the secondary general education should be drastically raised and university education be strengthened to bring up talented world-level scientists and technicians who would be responsible for the drive for building a thriving socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to give full play to the advantages of socialist healthcare system and create and disseminate more masterpieces of the times. Sports should be popularized to make the hot sports wind sweep across the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should make the people create the noble and highly civilized socialist culture as well as enjoy them, thereby injecting vitality and enthusiasm into the whole society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to bring about a decisive turn in building a thriving socialist nation just as was intended and desired by Kim Jong Il it is necessary to increase the function and role of the party organizations before anything else and officials should fulfill their responsibilities and roles as commanding members of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The officials should become true and able persons like Kim Chaek who successfully carried out any tasks, upholding Kim Il Sung. They should stand in the van of the ranks, become scouts blazing a trail and play the role of a locomotive in leading the masses in the field.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials exist for the people, not vice versa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The officials should learn from Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's view on the people and share weal and woe with them while sharing meal with them, and work harder and harder for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should accomplish the historic cause of national reunification true to the life-long intention and behests of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should conduct positive external activities and contribute to the cause of global independence true to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's strategy and plan for external activities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are always with us and encourage us. We should bear this in mind and work with redoubled efforts and successfully materialize their plan and desire and thus glorify the new century of the Juche revolution as a century of victory and glory."

            "content": "DPRK's Satellites for Peaceful Purposes to Continue Orbiting Space: KCST Spokesman \r\n Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology (KCST) Thursday released the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the KCST's announcement of the planned launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3 on March 16, the issue of the DPRK's satellite launch has become topic of debate in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who sympathize with truth and love justice were unanimous in praising the plan with much expectation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the unjust and ill-tempered hostile forces have worked hard to mislead public opinion with groundless assertions and sophism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and their special class stooge Lee Myung Bak are taking the lead in the smear campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is their brigandish assertion and their lackey's nonsensical talk that the DPRK should not be allowed to launch a satellite for peaceful purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They claim that as Kwangmyongsong-3 was launched by Unha carrier rocket, it was not a satellite but a long-range missile and it, therefore, seriously threatened the U.S. mainland and Japanese archipelago and made south Korea unstable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finally, they made a far-fetched assertion that the DPRK's launch of the above-said satellite was \"a violation\" of the UNSC resolution and a grave \"violation\" of the DPRK-U.S. agreement and a military \"provocation\" to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to ask them whether the U.S. and other satellite launchers have ever launched their satellites after getting approval from someone and has there ever been a precedent that satellites lifted by carrier rockets of other countries were not termed satellites. Did the U.S. or Japan lift their satellites with puffs of breath or with magic strength? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe have never recognized the UNSC resolution, a product of sinister intentions of the hostile forces. Moreover, it does not contain any paragraph banning satellite launch of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The February 29 DPRK-U.S. agreement has no paragraph banning the satellite launch of the DPRK, except the paragraph which says the U.S. respects the sovereignty of the DPRK and no longer antagonizes it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation goes to prove that it is none other than the U.S., Japanese reactionaries and the Lee group blindly following them that cooked up the illegal resolution and are unilaterally scrapping the bilateral agreement by abusing it in wanton violation of other country's sovereignty and the fair international order.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the UNSC, which has lost impartiality as an international body long ago, again issued its presidential statement finding fault with the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes than the Lee Myung Bak group recklessly kicked off a smear campaign to please its master as if it had been waiting for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This disgusting behavior of the traitor reminiscent of a rabid dog's desperate barking is shame on the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KCST clarifies the following principled stand after coolly following the moves of different forces before and after the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. It is necessary to eliminate as early as possible such special class stooges as traitor Lee in order to develop space science and technology of the nation as required by the age of knowledge-based economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, Lee Myung Bak is an underwit with 2MB of knowledge in terms of science and technology and he lacks even elementary scientific thinking ability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He claimed that the DPRK's satellite launch was a product of \"arms race,\" unable to distinguish a satellite from a long-range missile. This is because he is such underwit that he is unable to judge even the most elementary issue of politics and military affair. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned peculiar craftiness and disposition as a dealer while living in Japan and became a running dog of the U.S. and Japanese masters. It is quite natural for this guy to lack such great thinking ability as a human being. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As it became clear that the north was supposed to launch a satellite, Lee quickly echoed his master's demand for holding it in check and is now barking like a rabid dog. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is Lee who never misses the chance to bluster \"the launch of missile should be checked at any cost\" and \"there will be international aid and cooperation if the north dismantles nukes and opts for reforms and opening\", unaware of where he stands. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among the successive \"masters\" of Chongwadae there was no such \"immature president,\" \"foolish president\" and \"ignorant president\" as Lee Myung Bak. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that the  south Korean political and social circles are becoming vocal demanding Lee quit politics as early as possible, describing his four year-term politics as \"failed politics\", \"wicked politics\" and \"politics with nothing worth retrospection.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee should respond to the desire and demand of the mindset of people by leaving this world, though belatedly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable stand of the KCST that such human scum as Lee should be eliminated at an early date to develop space science and technology of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. In order to put space science and technology on orbit, it is necessary to shatter all the obstructions of the hostile forces in the field of science and technology, too, and firmly protect the sovereignty of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sovereignty is what keeps the country and the nation alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any country and nation deprived of its sovereignty is more dead than alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the Korean people have as ever struggled with the indomitable faith and will that they cannot abandon the sovereignty of the country and the nation though they may sacrifice their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To launch satellites is the DPRK's legitimate right to independence and it is an exercise of sovereignty in line with the Outer Space Treaty which stipulates the use of space for peaceful purposes shall be the right of all countries. Accordingly, the U.S. or any other existing satellite launchers are not entitled to interfere in the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If such arrogant encroachment upon the sovereignty of the DPRK by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and their followers are overlooked, they will try to deprive people of the most elementary right to existence, their right to eat, use and live in the long run.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ambition of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and their followers for domination under the jungle law to deter the DPRK from launching satellites for peaceful purposes if it does not yield to their high-handed and arbitrary practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation is no longer a miserable weak one in a colony in the past when it regarded sycophancy and ruined nation as its fate. It is no longer a weak country which had been ruthlessly trampled down by big powers after being reduced to a theater for re-dividing colonies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our socialist country is a full-fledged political and military power which put the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country onto the highest level in the world as it is holding the great men in high esteem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Absolutely intolerable is the outrageous attempt of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and their followers to stretch tentacles of aggression and domination even to space. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast stand of the Korean Committee for Space Technology to achieve the equal development of space science and technology by thoroughly protecting the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The army and people of the DPRK will shatter all the obstructions of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and their followers and more dynamically advance for the peaceful use of space along the road of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scientists and technicians of the DPRK have already wound up the specific and scientific probe into the cause of Kwangmyongsong-3's failure to enter its orbit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the scientific and technological data and precious experience gained this time will serve as a very precious boon to space development and a reliable guarantee for greater success in the days ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have a comprehensive state plan for space development including expansion and strengthening of space development institutions as required by latest science and technology and continued launch of working satellites needed for the country's economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now keen to deprive the DPRK of its right to space development while showing off food \"aid\" worth a petty amount of money but it is nothing but a foolish dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army and people have lived without any U.S. \"support\" and someone's \"cooperation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have all substantial foundations for enabling our people to fully enjoy wealth and prosperity under socialism, without tightening their belts any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The might of our socialist country can never be gauged by the calculation method of those obsessed by money making such as Lee Myung Bak or by the calculation method of the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and their followers should deeply grasp the profound meaning of the aphorism that the single-minded unity and invincible military capability plus the industrial revolution in the new century precisely mean our thriving socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sky-high spirit of Juche Korea dynamically advancing toward the development of cutting-edge science and technology will be fully displayed in the struggle to conquer space, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will clearly know how the struggle for justice and truth for protecting sovereignty will be crowned with victory, while watching dignified satellites of the DPRK being put into vast space one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how loudly the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and their followers may cry and no matter how frantically the Lee Myung Bak group of rats may squeak, the DPRK's satellites for peaceful purposes will be put into space one after another."

            "content": "S. Korean Regime Accused of Desecrating Day of Sun Events \r\n Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The DPRK government, political parties and organizations issued the following statement on Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation and humankind celebrated the centenary of the birth of President Kim Il Sung as the most auspicious grand festival of the century at a time when songs praising the peerlessly great man reverberated far and wide in the world along with the ever-lasting April of the sun's Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The grand festival held to mark the 100th Day of the Sun amid the great jubilation and excitement of all the Koreans and people of the rest of the world was a manifestation of boundless praise of the whole Korean nation and humankind of Kim Il Sung, who brought a bright hope for national resurrection to the country torn with distress due to flunkeyism and national ruin and ushered in a new era of history in which the independent life and happiness of the popular masses were blooming and of General Secretary Kim Jong Il, who enabled the Korean nation to demonstrate its dignity, pride and wisdom before the whole world. It was, at the same time, an expression of the highest tribute and the most profound thanks to the benefactors of the nation and the peerlessly great men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, it was a great event which showed the bright future of the sun's Korea and demonstrated the unbreakable, harmonious whole before the world which will bring a reunified thriving nation and socialist wealth and prosperity in the new centenary of Juche by having Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un at the helm of the Songun revolution and carrying forward the will of the great persons of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Never has Korea made all its people seethe with such joy and excitement and drawn such close attention of the world as the recent celebrations of the 100th Day of the Sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors hell-bent on confrontation with fellow countrymen committed such thrice-cursed high treason as chilling the atmosphere of the great national jubilee and letting loose a whole string of invectives, far from congratulating them on the day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt a time when the celebrations of the Day of the Sun were under way in the DPRK, in particular, traitor Lee made a public appearance and jabbered that the north might spend a ridiculous amount of money for launching a long-range missile and that amount of fund would be enough to buy a large quantity of maize. Echoing his outbursts, ultra-right conservative media spread the story that the north spent a fabulous amount of fund for the celebrations of the Day of the Sun, talking about \"funds for feast\" and the like, adding that the amount of funds would be enough to procure food for several years' consumption.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is lashing all the service personnel and people across the country into great fury as it is an unpardonable insult and hideous provocation against their leader, social system and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From olden times, Koreans used to say nothing is more sinful than spraying ash on the feast table of neighbors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even people of many other countries with different languages and races shared joy with Koreans, sincerely congratulating them on their great jubilee. But it is only the group of traitors, displeased with it, made such fuss, even spreading misinformation about the expenses for the events. This glaringly shows how wicked the Lee group is and how frantic it goes with confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's frantic smear campaign is nothing but the last-ditch efforts to tarnish the international image of the DPRK, break the single-minded unity of the party and the people and quell the lively response evoked by the celebrations of the Day of the Sun at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's recent grand celebrations of the Day of the Sun are a striking demonstration of its tremendous national power and potential.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors seems to be ignorant of all these stark facts as it is free to let loose such nonsense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is intolerable is that the puppet group is busy with the above-said smear campaign while decrying the celebrations of the Day of the Sun, deliberately talking about a financial estimate. This is a mockery and insult to the unblemished and ardent loyalty of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors, the most wicked group of sharks, can never understand the noble spiritual world and dignity and pride of the army and people of the DPRK which it can never buy even with tens of millions of tons of gold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people have traversed only the road of victory, weathering stern ordeals in defence of their independent dignity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies the mental power with which the Korean people have turned the DPRK into an invincible power under the uplifted banner of Songun while tightening their belts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before speaking ill of the north over expenses and the like, the Lee Myung Bak group had better think over its own wretched plight: It has become a target of the people's judgment for squandering a fabulous amount of money collected from the people as  taxes for the upkeep of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in south Korea and moves for a war against the DPRK and converting south Korea into a dark society and a land ridden with suicides where the rich gets richer and the poor poorer while seeking personal luxury and glory, engrossed in irregularities and corruptions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group recklessly desecrated even the celebrations of the Day of the Sun in the wake of hideous provocative acts of malignantly besmirching the events held over the great loss to the nation and hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. This indicates that the group is making desperate efforts to do harm to the DPRK's social system and single-minded unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and the people of the DPRK consider the dignity of the supreme leadership and the harmonious whole with the leader as dearer than their own lives. They, therefore, will never pardon anyone who provokes them even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolish, indeed, for the group to try to break the harmonious whole in which the leader and the people are united in the noblest will and feelings and their unity is growing stronger day by day, talking about such financial estimate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By blatantly insulting and challenging our leader, social system and people, the group revealed itself that it is the sworn enemy with whom the Korean nation can never live under the same sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un in his speech at the military parade for celebrating the centenary of the birth of the President clarified the magnanimous and positive stand that we will join hands with whoever wants the reunification of the country and the peace and prosperity of the nation. The group of traitors, however, responded to this with its reckless and sinister smear campaign, a clear indication of its sinister intention to keep to the road of confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The patience of the army and people of the DPRK has reached its limit. Their hearts are burning with the determination to wipe out the group of traitors in this land to the last man so that they may not kick off any longer such racket as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people will no longer remain a passive onlooker to the smear campaign of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The arms and artillery pieces of all the service personnel and people are ready to fire bullets and bombs for revenge. The weaponry of Mt. Paektu is clearly aimed at the wicked traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should apologize at once for its hideous acts of desecrating the events held on the Day of the Sun in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Otherwise, all the service personnel and people of the DPRK will turn out in a sacred war for revenge, giving vent to their towering resentment, and make a clean sweep of the puppet group of traitors from this land once and for all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conservative media and wicked media persons keen on the smear campaign for hurting the dignity of the DPRK in collusion with traitor Lee Myung Bak will never be excluded from severe punishment as they have committed despicable crimes against the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group would be well advised to properly understand all the service personnel and people of the DPRK, their hearts burning with the resolution to take a thousand-fold revenge, and stop its rash acts."

Al margen de ellas, no se puede pensar en el avance victorioso y el cumplimiento de nuestra causa revolucionaria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Solo cuando tengamos al General como eterno Secretario General de nuestro Partido,  podemos impulsar vigorosamente tambien en el futuro al igual que en el pasado la revolucion y la construccion y llevar a feliz termino la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La Conferencia del PTC proclamara al interior y exterior que el PTC es la gloriosa organizacion del camarada Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La idea directriz del PTC es el gran Kimilsunismo-Kimjongilismo. El PTC es la gloriosa organizacion kimilsunista-kimjongilista que toma por su idea directriz el Kimilsunismo-Kimjongilismo y lucha por ponerlo en practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsunismo-Kimjongilismo es el maximo programa de nuestro Partido. Esta labor es la continuacion revolucionaria de la transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsunismo y su desarrollo en la nueva y superior etapa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al igual que venimos luchando tenazmente bajo la sabia guia del gran General presentando como maximo programa del Partido la transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsunismo, debemos luchar intensamente en lo adelante por transformar toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsunismo-Kimjongilismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por muy enormes que fueran nuestras tareas de la revolucion, es definitiva nuestra victoria porque contamos con extraordinarios lideres, eterno Sol del Juche, el invencible PTC, el pueblo infinitamente fiel al Partido y la Lider, y el poderoso ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debemos glorificar para siempre la vida revolucionaria del General y sus inmortales hazanas revolucionarias enalteciendolo como eterno lider del PTC y el pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El fue gran Dirigente, patriota sin igual y padre generoso del pueblo que dedico todo lo suyo por la prosperidad de la patria y la felicidad del pueblo dando pruebas de su fidelidad absoluta al gran Lider y su calido amor por la patria y el pueblo. Su vida fue la mas brillante del Gran Hombre sin par que realizo imperecederas proezas ante el Partido, la revolucion, la patria y el pueblo acatando el noble proposito del gran Lider.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debemos cumplir con conciencia inmaculada y obligacion moral todas las labores para enaltecer eternamente al gran General y realizar la causa de eternidad del lider.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desarrollar nuestro Partido como eterno Partido del camarada Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il significa mantener con firmeza el Kimilsunismo-Kimjongilismo como la idea directriz del Partido y realizar la construccion y las actividades del Partido de acuerdo con la idea y el proposito de estos grandes hombres. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo mas importante para este fin es establecer con mas firmeza el sistema de direccion unica del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los militantes del Partido, los oficiales y soldados del EPC y los habitantes deben apoyar con fe y conciencia la idea y la direccion del Partido, unirse compactamente en lo ideo-volitivo y lo moral en torno al Comite Central del Partido y compartir siempre la vida o muerte con nuestro Partido tanto en los dias normales como en los arduos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tenemos que fortalecer por todos los medios la unidad monolitica del Partido y las filas de la revolucion y defenderla firmemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La unidad monolitica es la mas valiosa herencia revolucionaria que nos dejo el General y lo mas importante en la revolucion coreana. Nuestra unidad monolitica entre el lider, el Partido y las masas a base de la gran idea, calido amor y afecto es el tesoro mas grande que no se cambiaria ni con montones de oro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debemos respetar mucho al pueblo y defender consecuentemente sus intereses considerandolos como absolutos y atenderlo con el afecto de verdadera madre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En pleno acato al noble proposito del gran Lider y el gran General, quienes consideraron como la maxima de vida el ideario Iminwichon (considerar al pueblo como el cielo), se debe respetar mucho al pueblo y realizar todos los trabajos dando prioridad a su demanda e intereses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hace falta hacer reinar en todo el pais las nobles y bellas costumbres de ayuda reciproca para convertir la sociedad en una gran familia armoniosa y unida monoliticamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La conducta heroica del ex minero de la Mina de Kumgol, Pak Thae Son, y ex granjero de la Granja Cooperativa de Ohyon del distrito de Yon-an, Ri Chang Son, quienes ofrendaron sin vacilacion sus valiosas vidas para el colectivo y los camaradas, es la virtud visible solo en los seres humanos de nuestra epoca formados por el gran Lider y el gran General y el ejemplo que debemos aprender todos nosotros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Songun (priorizacion militar) implica nuestra independencia, dignidad y vida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Si es debil en las fuerzas armadas, no se puede defender su soberania ni derecho a la existencia y se convierte finalmente en el objeto de ultrajes y la victima de los imperialistas, esto es la realidad irrefutable de hoy y por eso, debemos impulsar constantemente los quehaceres encaminados a incrementar el poderio militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El poderio del Songun es precisamente el del EPC y consolidarlo es la cuestion fundamental para fortalecer las fuerzas militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como grueso de la revolucion, el EPC debe ser siempre el abanderado y brigada de choque tanto en la defensa de la patria como en la materializacion del proyecto del Partido en materia de la construccion de un Estado prospero y el precursor en la creacion y divulgacion de la cultura del Songun en el nuevo siglo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es preciso establecer estrictamente en toda la sociedad el clima de dar importancia a los asuntos militares y fortalecer el sistema de defensa de todo el pueblo y todo el Estado, de manera tal que todo el pais se haga una fortaleza inexpugnable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    Tenemos que producir un viraje decisivo en el mejoramiento de los niveles de la vida del pueblo y en la construccion de la potencia economica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hay que beneficiarse de las preciosas bases preparadas por el General para que sea mas feliz en el mundo el pueblo coreano, que confia siempre y apoya unicamente al Partido. Esto fue el anhelo del gran General, y es la firme decision y voluntad de nuestro Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es preciso revitalizar cuanto antes los dominios avanzados de la economia nacional y las industrias basicas, mediante una tenaz ofensiva y en el fragor de la llamarada de Hamnam, con el fin de consolidar el fundamento de desarrollo economico y registrar un auge productivo en todos los sectores de la economia nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para revitalizaar la economia nacional, estabilizar y mejorar la vida del pueblo, resulta imperioso dar prioridad a los dominios electrico, carbonifero, metalurgico y ferroviario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debemos convertir nuestro pais en una potencia economica basada en la intelectualidad avivando las llamas de la revolucion industrial del nuevo siglo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Debemos luchar con meta e ideal ambiciosos y superar el nivel mundial en todos los planos segun el proposito del General de poner los pies en la tierra patria con la mirada hacia el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tenemos que desplegar con dinamismo la campana de conquista de las tecnologias sofisticadas con el espiritu de exploracion y modo de creacion de los empleados de Ryonha, quienes alcanzaron un desarrollo vertiginoso en la produccion de las maquinas herramientas CNC, para alcanzar el nivel mundial en la calidad del conjunto de equipos tecnicos del pais y perfeccionar la estructura de la economia en lo conveniente a la epoca de la economia basada en intelectualidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debemos aportar la fuerza a la administracion territorial para transformar la patria como el paraiso del pueblo mas hermoso y confortable a vivir.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es preciso concentrar al Consejo de Ministros todos los problemas que se presentan en las labores economicas y establecer estrictamente la disciplina y el orden de resolverlas segun el mando unificado del Consejo de Ministros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Consejo de Ministros, comandancia economica responsable por los asuntos economicos del pais, debe establecer con vistas al futuro y de modo cientifico y realista la meta y la estrategia de desarrollo economico y realizar con iniciativa y resueltamente el control, la direccion y la administracion de todas las cuestiones economicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los sectores y unidades deben resolver los problemas vinculados con la economia en coordinacion con el Consejo de Ministros e implementar sin falta las resoluciones e indicaciones del Consejo de Ministros orientadas al cumplimiento de las politicas economicas del Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al registrar sin parar el cambio revolucionario en todos los sectores de la construccion cultural como educacion, salud publica, literatura y arte y deportes, debemos dignificar nuestro pais como Estado socialista avanzado y culto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hacen falta aumentar la inversion estatal en el sector docente, modernizar las instituciones y equipos de educacion, elevar decisivamente el nivel de educacion general de ensenanza media y mejorar la calidad de educacion superior para formar mucho mas talentosos hombres cientifico-tecnicos de talla mundial, encargados de la construccion de Estado prospero socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que poner de pleno manifiesto la superioridad del sistema socialista de salud publica de nuestro pais, crear y divulgar muchos mas obras maestras que representen la epoca, y levantar la oleada deportiva en todo el pais mediante la masificacion del deporte. De esta manera, debemos lograr que nuestro pueblo sea creador y gozador de la noble cultura socialista en algo grado de civilizacion y reine en toda la sociedad el ambiente jubiloso y optimista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara traer un viraje decisivo en la construccion de un Estado prospero socialista segun el proposito y el anhelo del Dirigente Kim Jong Il, debemos elevar, ante todo, la funcion y el papel de las organizaciones partidistas y los funcionarios deben cumplir su responsabilidad y el papel de miembros de mando de la revolucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los funcionarios deben prepararse como competentes y sinceros cuadros como Kim Chaek quien cumplio con excelencia cualquier dificil tarea en apoyo al Presidente Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy les toca a los funcionarios ponerse al frente de las filas y ellos deben ser soldados de avanzada que abran paso en el camino nevado intransitado y locomotoras que conduzcan a las filas al pie de los talleres de trabajo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo existe el pueblo para el funcionario sino viceversa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos funcionarios deben compartir la vida o la muerte y la alegria o la pena con el pueblo comiendo lo mismo que come este al aprender la concepcion del pueblo del gran Lider y el General y esforzarse tanto por hacer favores al pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos realizar sin falta la historica causa de reunificacion de la patria materializando cabalmente el proposito de toda la vida y el legado del gran Lider y el General y desarrollar activamente las actividades exteriores en pleno acato a la estrategia y el proposito del Lider y el General en materia de la estrategia y proyecto de actividades exteriores para contribuir al cumplimiento de la causa de la independencia en el mundo entero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTeniendo presente que el gran Lider y el General nos estimulan viviendo siempre en nosotros, debemos hacer ingentes esfuerzos por llevar a efecto el proposito y el anhelo del Lider y el General y glorificar la nueva centuria de la revolucion jucheana como anales llenos de victorias y glorias."

Ademas, en ese documento no aparece ningun articulo que prohibe el lanzamiento de satelite artificial por parte de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el Acuerdo RPDC-EE.UU. del 29 de febrero, si hay el parrafo de respetar la soberania de la RPDC y no hostilizarla mas, pero no hay el que desaprueba el lanzamiento de satelite artificial por ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra claramente que los reaccionarios norteamericanos y japoneses y la satelite banda surcoreana de Lee Myung Bak violan flagrantemente la soberania de otros paises y el imparcial orden internacional abusando de la resolucion inventada ilegalmente por ellos mismos y quiebran unilateralmente el acuerdo bilateral. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCoincidiendo con que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, organizacion internacional que perdio la imparcialidad hace mucho tiempo, publico otra vez la declaracion presidencial cuestionando el lanzamiento de satelite pacifico de la RPDC, Lee Myung Bak y otros traidores surcoreanos de peor calana estan pronunciando ultimamente unos disparates para congraciarse con su amo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conducta de Lee, igual a un viejo perro sarnoso, es una verguenza de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA base de la observacion serena de los movimientos de diferentes fuerzas antes y despues del lanzamiento de ese satelite artificial con fines pacificos, el CTEC declara la siguiente posicion de principios:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, Para situar la ciencia y tecnologia espaciales de la nacion al nivel de la epoca de economia basada en intelectualidad, se debe eliminar cuanto antes al traidor Lee Myung Bak y otros lacayos de peor calana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee es un tonto con un indice de inteligencia de 2 MB (mega bytes) en el termino cientifico-tecnico e imbecil que no tiene ni la elemental facultad de pensamiento cientifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, ese tipejo incapaz de comprender ni las elementales cuestiones politicas y militares califico como producto de \"carrera armamentista\" el lanzamiento de satelite artificial de la RPDC sin poder determinar si es satelite o misil balistico de largo alcance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imposible que Lee, crecido en la tierra japonesa adquiriendo la astucia y la mezquindad de negociante y convertido en un perro mimado de sus amos gringo y japones, tenga la elevada facultad de pensar del hombre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, el repite sin ninguna consideracion la opinion de sus amos de impedir el lanzamiento del satelite artificial de la RPDC, aunque es el de compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgnorando su situacion miserable, el dice atrevidamente que \"hay que frenarlo a toda costa porque es lanzamiento de misil\" y \"si el Norte cancela su arma nuclear y procede a la reforma y apertura, habra la asistencia y cooperacion internacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNi entre los anteriores \"inquilinos\" de Chongwadae hubo un \"presidente tan inmaduro, estupido e ignorante\" como Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que los circulos politico y social del Sur de Corea exijan cada vez mas fuerte la retirada pronta de Lee del escenario politico criticando las politicas practicadas en 4 anos de su mandato como las \"fracasadas, malvadas e innecesarias para recordar\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee debe responder con su abandono del mundo a la aspiracion y la demanda de la opinion publica aunque sea tardo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs la invariable posicion de CTEC liquidar lo mas pronto posible Lee y otras escorias humanas para renovar la ciencia y la tecnologia cosmicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, para poner en la orbita la ciencia y tecnica espaciales, deben frustrar todas las maniobras obstructivas de las fuerzas hostiles tambien en esta rama y defender cabalmente la soberania del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La soberania deviene la vida del pais y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si se la pierde es igual que la muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Venimos luchando con la conviccion y la voluntad de no poder abandonar la soberania del pais y la nacion aunque sacrifiquemos nuestra vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El lanzamiento del satelite artificial es el digno derecho independiente de la RPDC y el ejercicio de la soberania conveniente al \"Tratado espacial\" que define el uso pacifico del espacio como derecho de todos los  paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, Estados Unidos y los paises lanzadores del satelite no tienen el derecho a meterse en el lanzamiento de nuestro satelite artificial con fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si dejan intactos los reaccionarios de EE.UU. y Japon y sus seguidores que atentan la soberania de otros paises, ellos quitaran hasta el mas elemental derecho a existencia de muchos hombres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La ambicion dominacionista de los reaccionarios norteamericanos y japoneses y sus seguidores, basada en la ley de la selva, es impedir que un pais lance hasta el satelite con fines pacificos si no se doblega a sus coacciones y arbitrariedades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La nacion coreana no es la nacion colonial debil anterior que debia sufrir como suerte el servilismo a grandes potencias y el arruinamiento del pais ni tampoco el pais pequeno pisoteado por las potencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nuestra patria socialista es la digna potencia politica y militar que al contar con los grandes hombres sin pares situo en la suprema posicion en el mundo la dignidad de la nacion y la soberania del  pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No hay que tolerar el intento brutal de los reaccionarios norteamericanos y japoneses y sus seguidores de extender hasta el espacio sus tentaculos de agresion y dominio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La invariable posicion del Comite de Tecnologias Espaciales de Corea (CTEC) es lograr el desarrollo  igualitario de la ciencia y tecnica espaciales al defender cabalmente la dignidad de la nacion y la soberania del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tercero, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC avanzaran con mas firmeza por el camino del Songun para el uso pacifico del espacio frustrando todos estorbos de los reaccionarios norteamericanos y japoneses y sus seguidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nuestros cientificos y tecnicos ya terminaron el esclarecimiento detallado y cientifico sobre la causa de que \"Kwangmyongsong-3\" no entro en la orbita.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los datos cientificos y tecnicos y la experiencia preciosa obtenidos en esta oportunidad seran la preciosa base y garantia confiable que promete mayores exitos en el desarrollo del espacio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC tiene un universal programa estatal de desarrollo espacial que preve ampliar y consolidar los aparatos de desarrollo espacial de acuerdo con las ciencias de punta y lanzar continuamente los satelites artificiales de usos practicos, imprescindibles al desarrollo de economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, Estados Unidos intenta privar a la RPDC del derecho al desarrollo cosmico tentandola con la barata \"asistencia\" de alimentos, lo cual no pasa de ser una vana ilusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos militares y civiles de la RPDC vinieron viviendo hasta ahora no con la \"asistencia\" de EE.UU. ni con la \"cooperacion\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC tiene suficiente base para hacer a su pueblo vivir en la opulencia socialista sin que vuelva a sufrir la escasez economica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo podran valorar nunca el poderio de la RPDC con el metodo de calculacion de los negociantes como Lee Myung Bak o de los imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios norteamericanos y japoneses y sus fuerzas seguidoras deben parafrasear con seriedad esta frase celebre (del Maximo Dirigente Kim Jong Un): el Estado prospero socialista es precisamente la unidad monolitica + el invencible poderio militar + la revolucion industrial del nuevo siglo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl impetu de la Corea del Juche, que avanza para tomar las ciencias y tecnicas supersofisticadas, se pondra de pleno manifiesto tambien en la conquista del cosmos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo sera testigo de como triunfa la lucha justa por la defensa de soberania y por la verdad, viendo los satelites de la RPDC que se inyectaran sucesivamente en el espacio cosmico sin fin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque los reaccionarios estadounidenses y japoneses y sus seguidores como la banda de ratones de Lee cuestionen mucho, los satelites artificiales con fines pacificos de la RPDC se lanzaran al espacio uno tras otro a una velocidad vertiginosa."

En particular, constituye un gran acontecimiento que hizo ver a todo el mundo el maravilloso porvenir y la indestructible unidad monolitica de la Corea del Sol, que construira en la nueva centuria del Juche una gran potencia prospera reunificada y propiciara una vida opulenta en el socialismo teniendo al Comandante Supremo       Kim Jong Un en la jefat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t ura de la revolucion del Songun en acato al legado de los Grandes Hombres sin iguales del monte Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, las celebraciones del 100o Dia del Sol conmovieron mas que nunca a todos los compatriotas y centraron la mayor atencion mundial en Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak, enloquecida por la confrontacion fratricida, fue la unica que lejos de felicitar esa gran fiesta nacional, cometio el crimen de traicion nunca perdonable de envenenar el clima festivo con sus disparates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJustamente cuando se realizaban los festejos del Dia del Sol, el mismo traidor Lee dijo unas boberias como que el Norte (de Corea) habra gastado en el lanzamiento del misil de largo alcance una gran suma de dinero con que se podria comprar una cantidad considerable de maiz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn referencia a los llamados \"gastos de fiesta\", los medios de prensa ultraderechistas del Sur de Corea  informaron con mala intencion que el Norte ha gastado colosales fondos en los festejos del Dia del Sol y habria asegurado con esa suma los alimentos para varios anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta difamacion causa gran indignacion de los militares y civiles de todo el pais siendo un insulto insoportable y grave provocacion a nuestro lider, nuestro regimen y nuestro pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde remota antiguedad, se decia que estropear la fiesta del vecino es una de las peores maldades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nueva campana anti-RPDC, que lanza con disgusto la camarilla de traidores surcoreanos inventando los gastos de festejo cuando numerosos extranjeros de diferentes lenguas y razas comparten la alegria con nuestro pueblo felicitando sinceramente la gran fiesta nacional, es una muestra directa de que ella tiene un genio avieso y esta enloquecida por el enfrentamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSignifica tambien el ultimo coletazo de los que pretenden mellar la imagen exterior de la RPDC, destruir la unidad monolitica entre nuestro Partido y pueblo y frenar a toda costa las grandes repercusiones de los festejos solemnes del Dia del Sol que manifestaron el inagotable poderio nacional y la potencialidad de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo sabia acaso la banda de Lee Myung Bak cuando dijo sus chismes?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa demagogia, que libra esta camarilla calculando con el dinero los actos del Dia del Sol, es una burla e insulto a la inmaculada y calida fidelidad de nuestro ejercito y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos tipejos avaros no podran comprender nunca  el noble mundo espiritual, la dignidad y el orgullo de los militares y civiles de la RPDC que no se puede comprar ni con montones de oro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro pueblo vino avanzando por el unico camino de victorias superando duras pruebas para defender su dignidad independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui el poderio espiritual con que el convirtio a la RPDC en una potencia invencible bajo la bandera del Songun resistiendo la escasez economica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de censurar hablando de los supuestos \"gastos\", la banda del traidor Lee deberia prestar atencion a su miserable situacion a punto de ser enjuiciada por la opinion publica por haber malgastado los impuestos pagados con sangre por la poblacion surcoreana en el mantenimiento de tropas agresoras norteamericanas y los ejercicios de guerra anti-RPDC y convertido el suelo surcoreano en el reino de adinerados y el infierno para los pobres con una tasa record de suicidio cometiendo actos ilicitos y de corrupcion para la vida opulenta y lujosa de si misma.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa difamacion de los actos del Dia del Sol, antecedida por el insulto de gran duelo nacional y maxima dignidad de la RPDC, es una muestra de que los titeres surcoreanos estan desesperados para calumniar el regimen de la RPDC y destruir su unidad monolitica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC aprecian mas que su vida la maxima dignidad de su lider y la unidad de cuerpo y alma con el y no perdonan ni en lo minimo a los que se atreven a atentarlas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs tan absurda la ilusion de destruir esa unidad, que se hace cada vez mas solida con el proposito y fraternidad mas nobles, circulando el rumor de la supuesta \"malversacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl calumniar y desafiar frontalmente a nuestro lider, regimen y pueblo, los traidores surcoreanos expusieron su naturaleza de enemigos jurados que no pueden convivir con la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, respondio atrevidamente con la campana intrigante a la posicion magnanima y activa del Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Un al pronunciar el discurso en el lugar de desfile por el centenario de natalicio del Presidente Kim Il Sung de que tomara las manos de quienes desean la reunificacion del pais y la paz y la prosperidad de la nacion. Esto es una demostracion de maligno intento de seguir tomando el camino de la confrontacion fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, la paciencia del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea llego al punto de limite y estos estan dispuestos a aniquilarla para que no difame mas la maxima dignidad de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no estaran con los brazos cruzados ante la campana intrigante de la banda traidora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos fusiles del monte Paektu tomados por todo el ejercito y el pueblo estan cargados con las balas de venganza y apuntan claramente a los traidores vendepatrias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora debe pedir disculpa de inmediato por sus tremendos crimenes que ofendieron los actos de la RPDC por el Dia del Sol.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi no lo hace, todo el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea se levantaran en la lucha sagrada de venganza estallando en colera y aniquilaran por completo a la banda traidora en esta tierra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos medios conservadores de prensa y recalcitrantes publicistas que difaman la dignidad de la RPDC junto con el traidor Lee no pueden liberarse de los criminales antinacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere debe actuar con prudencia dando clara cuenta del espiritu de todo el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea que arden del sentimiento de venganza."
