This call is disgusting sophism and an intolerable mockery of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHis recent grumble is nothing but a replica of his watchwords \"no nuke, opening and 3,000 dollars\", a declaration on his anti-reunification stand seeking confrontation and war, and it revealed once again the group of traitors' stance for confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What \"true\", a favorite word of the traitor, meant was more clearly evidenced by his recent remarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee Myung Bak, forsaken by the people in south Korea, dared defame the dignified people in the DPRK as \"compatriots in the north\".
