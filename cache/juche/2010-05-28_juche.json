            "content": "NDC Holds Press Conference on \"Cheonan\" Sinking\r\n Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The National Defence Commission of the DPRK held a press conference at the People's Palace of Culture Friday denouncing the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors of south Korea for having recently kicked off a racket of confrontation with the DPRK after groundlessly linking the case of the sinking of warship \"Cheonan\" with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were Korean and foreign reporters, representatives and military attaches of foreign embassies and representatives of international organizations here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Maj. General of the Korean People's Army Pak Rim Su, director of the Policy Department of the NDC, spoke at the press conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the fact that the situation created after the case of warship \"Cheonan\" cooked up by the group of traitors is so grave that a war may break out anytime, he stressed that any accidental clash that may break out in the waters of the West Sea of Korea or in areas along the Demilitarized Zone will lead to an all-out war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities persistently refused the field inspection, unilaterally insisting on the forged \"results of investigation\" out of guilty conscience, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He disclosed the truth behind the case as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case of the warship sinking is a fabrication and charade orchestrated by the south Korean puppet authorities from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, we can say this because the \"scientific investigation\" and \"objective investigation\" touted by the south Korean authorities were nonsensical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To begin with, the \"team for investigation\" was formed in such a way that it could not make a scientific and objective investigation, and this is clear from the fact that the south Korean military supervised the investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that in what direction its results were worked out because the investigation was supervised by those who should be tried for being chief culprits of the case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"international joint investigation team\" was also made up of those countries which were not in a position to conduct an objective investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States was included in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is in the hostile relationship with the DPRK as it is still technically at war with it, and countries including Britain, Australia and Canada which joined the team are also those countries which participated in the Korean war by toeing the U.S. line and are now cooperating with the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is which party the members of the team from those countries would side with and what conclusion they would make.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is the case with the \"civilian and military joint investigation team\". It raked up its brain to link \"the material evidence\" produced with the DPRK after supporting the story about \"the north's involvement\" the south Korean authorities spread before the results of investigation were announced.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that civilians involved in the investigation team were hindered in their movements, leading a prison life aboard the warship \"Tokdo\" of the south Korean navy, because they had been strictly isolated from the outside since the start of investigation. They were barred from taking part in the major investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, some were expelled from the investigation team for the mere reason that they made assertions contrary to the stand of the \"Ministry of Defense\" and even they were prosecuted for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The course in which the results of investigation changed several times and they were fabricated to gradually focus on the story about \"a torpedo attack of the north\" goes to prove that the investigation was unscientific and nonobjective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The time and place the sinking occurred changed several times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At first, it was stated that the case took place at 21: 45 and then it was corrected as 21:16, changing the time several times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side said that the warship was sunken near Paekryong Islet with lots of rocks, but later corrected that the place was changed into other place without rocks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It cannot be construed otherwise than intentional changes to draw a conclusion that the case was not an accident caused when the warship ran against rocks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The announcement of the stand on the question as to whether there was \"outside provocation\" or not was also repeatedly changed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The captain of the warship \"Cheonan\" who can be called irrefutable eyewitness said at first that \"there was not outside provocation at all.\" But, finally he said \"there was outside provocation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet military said at first that \"there was no ground whatsoever to say it was an attack from the north.\" But, finally it changed its stand by saying that \"the warship was sunken by a torpedo attack of the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It claimed there was no eyewitness who saw the column of water rising during the warship explosion, even among survivors of the warship. But later, it made a guard on Paekryong Islet far away from the waters where the ship sank state that he saw the white column of water 100m high in the pitch-dark. This was also a dastardly farce orchestrated by the group of traitors to link the case with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a lot of evidence to prove it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, therefore, categorically turns down and totally refutes the \"results of investigation\" announced by the south side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, a scrutiny into the \"evidence\" produced by the south Korean authorities makes it easy to guess that the story about \"a torpedo attack of the north\" is a sheer fabrication. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Senior Colonel of the KPA Ri Son Gwon, official of the Policy Department of the NDC, with the help of a visual aid analyzed \"pieces of evidence\" produced by the south side one by one. He cited facts to scientifically prove that they were nothing but a sheer fabrication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak said there is the need to think over which side of both the north and the south got benefit from such case of warship sinking. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The entire army and all the people of the DPRK are all out to bring about great innovations and leap forward in building a thriving nation in 2012, the historic year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Is there any reason for the DPRK to attack such south Korean patrol ship because it is channeling all its efforts into attaining the above-said gigantic goal?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only the group of traitors that required such shocking case, he noted, laying bare its ulterior intention as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case was needed by the group to justify its anti-DPRK moves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The policy of the present south Korean government is, in a word, to totally deny the policy of reconciliation, unity, cooperation and exchange which was followed in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, it is aimed to totally scrap the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, the programme for implementing it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This policy brought the inter-Korean relations to the brink of a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The resistance of the south Korean public against it has reached the point of explosion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Precisely for this reason, the south Korean authorities needed the case of the warship sinking by \"a torpedo attack of the north\" in a bid to spread among the south Korean people the conception that the DPRK is the \"principal enemy\", not fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next, the case was needed to justify the south Korean authorities' foreign policy put in a crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the existing agreement reached between the United States and south Korea, the \"right to command wartime operations\" is to be transferred to south Korea in 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If this happens, the U.S. forces will be deprived of any justification to stay in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This would deal a telling blow at the south Korean authorities as they regard the \"south Korea-U.S. alliance almighty\" as the core of their foreign policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For this reason, the south Korean authorities cooked up the fiction that the warship was sunken by \"an armed attack\" of the DPRK in a bid to hype such \"security uneasiness\" that a war may break out on the Korean Peninsula any time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case was also needed to rally the conservative forces in south Korea.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative ruling forces are now torn apart.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cannot but be a cause of anxiety for the present south Korean authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, they floated the story that the warship was sunken by \"a torpedo attack of the north\" in a bid to stir up confrontation with the DPRK and rally the conservative forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said case was also required to win in the forthcoming elections to local self-governing bodies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities egged the military warmongers on to groundlessly link the case with the DPRK in an effort to strain the situation and stoke the confrontation with it for the purpose of creating a phase favorable for winning in the elections. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the present, the farce was needed to evade their responsibility for the case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite evident that in case the sinking of the warship is confirmed to be caused by stranding from self-carelessness or the \"aging\" of the warship, the blame for it will rest with the commander-in-chief of the puppet armed forces and military bosses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors can prolong their remaining days only when it fakes up the conclusion that the warship was caused by the attack of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The noisy racket of confrontation with the DPRK kicked up by the group over the sinking of \"Cheonan\" is nothing but an act of precipitating its self-destruction as it is an undisguised declaration of a war against the DPRK and a hideous criminal act of driving the inter-Korean relations to the state of war.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has so far bolstered up its nuclear deterrent under the banner of Songun for the purpose of coping with such present acute situation. Its powerful physical means including nuclear weapons are not to be on display or to be stockpiled. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for the DPRK to demonstrate the mettle of its revolutionary armed forces. How the situation will develop entirely depends on the attitude of the group of traitors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon the authorization of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, Pak once again notified the participants of the important steps taken by the KPA. And he solemnly clarified the principled stand of the army and people of the DPRK to strongly retaliate against the frantic actions of the group of traitors to do harm to the dignified DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were answers to the questions raised at the conference."

            "content": "FM Accuses US of Creating Atmosphere of International Pressure\r\n Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry Friday released the following  statement in connection with the fact that the United States is becoming all the more reckless in its moves to create an atmosphere of international pressure upon the DPRK by referring the case of warship \"Cheonan\" to the UN Security Council:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the U.S. secretary of State let loose a spate of sheer lies to brand the DPRK as the chief culprit of the warship sinking during her junkets to Japan, China and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut a scrutiny into who is to benefit from the \"story about a torpedo attack by north Korea\" and what will be gained from it makes it clear that the case was orchestrated by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities. Firstly, the Obama administration is using the recent case for orchestrating with utmost efforts a farce to make it appear \"strong\" with the Congress mid-term election slated for coming November at hand as it was known to be weak externally in the first year of its administration. Secondly, the U.S. hyped the \"threat from north Korea\" to sound real, finally making the ruling Democratic Party of Japan, which had been keen to drive the U.S. forces out of Okinawa, yield to it. This is the reason why the \"results of investigation\" were announced within May. Thirdly, the U.S. has come to justify its policy of \"strategic patience\" designed to degrade the environment for international investment in the DPRK and steadily suffocate its economy. Fourthly, it became possible for the U.S. to put China into an awkward position and keep hold on Japan and south Korea as its servants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe truth remains unchanged though the U.S. sticks to its own opinion. The U.S. is blustering that it would refer the said case to the UNSC, but the UNSC is the very forum which had already been besmirched due to Powell's lies about Iraq in February 2003. The U.S., branding the case as a \"breach of the Armistice Agreement,\" instigated the south Korean authorities to spread the assertion that the case should be discussed at the \"Military Armistice Commission\" (MAC). This is also a self-contradiction. As far as the AA is concerned, it was reduced to a dead document long ago due to the U.S. The MAC has been defunct since the U.S. unilaterally recalled the senior member of the \"UN Forces\" side and replaced him with a \"general\" of the south Korean puppet army, not a signatory to the AA. As the MAC exists only in name, the U.S. government made a conclusion that the case is a \"violation of the AA\" before the \"UN Forces\" side of the MAC announced that it would make an investigation into the violation. Irony is that the U.S. secretary of State is vociferating about the AA, though she does not know in what shape the AA is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is pressurizing other countries to accept the \"results of investigation\" announced by south Korea, zealously supporting them but the \"investigation team\" formed by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities is vague and shady in its nature. What matters is that the team was made up with the south Korean military as the core and equally problematic was that the south Korean authorities included in that team some foreigners unilaterally chosen by them, letting it go by the name of \"international investigation team.\" There is no knowing whether these foreigners participated in the investigation on behalf of the governments of their countries or in private capacity and whether they had any mandate to investigate or borrowed only name and an agreement was reached on the \"results of investigation\" by going through any procedure. We proposed more than once dispatching an inspection group to the spot, but the U.S. and the south Korean authorities persistently refused to receve it. The reason can be explained by the above-said attitudes of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the U.S. and the south Korean authorities announced the \"results of investigation\" than they lost no time to threaten to slap additional sanctions and take counteractions regardless of whether the world understands those results or not. Herein lies an ulterior aim and this patently proves that they are acting according to the script already worked out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can occupy the Korean Peninsula just as it did Iraq with sheer lies. If the UNSC is again taken in by U.S. lies and tables the \"results of investigation\" into the \"Cheonan\" warship and discusses them, then this will mean that the UNSC is misused for encroaching upon the dignity of the Korean people and the sovereignty of the DPRK. In case the DPRK takes toughest self-defensive counter-measures as already declared, the U.S. and its servants will be wholly to blame for their consequences."

            "content": "KCNA: Who Wire-pulled Shocking Case behind Scene\r\n Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Many days have passed since the case of \"Cheonan\" occurred but the south Korean puppet authorities are going beyond the tolerance limit in their racket of confrontation with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t Quite many people have expressed their understanding of a lot of information provided by the relevant institutions of the DPRK several times to prove the irrefutable facts and the hard reality that there was no reason for the DPRK to get involved in such case. But the puppet group is getting more reckless as the days go by in its confrontation hysteria. Then why?  It is behaving so because it firmly believes in somebody's strong backing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But for the patronage and prodding of its master, the south Korean puppet group would have not gone the lengths of recklessly crying out for  \"retaliation\" and declaring \"it would not rule out even a war\" after daring to brand the DPRK as a \"criminal\" like puppies knowing no fear of a tiger. It is the United States that is behind the case of \"Cheonan\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case was cooked up and the \"results of investigation\" into it were published with the approval of the U.S. and under its patronage and manipulation from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The investigation was steered by the U.S. from its very outset. It approached the joint investigation from the standpoint hostile to the DPRK and branded it as a \"suspect,\" asserting that \"there was hardly any other \"suspect except north Korea\" and \"the warship was most probably sunken by a torpedo attack of north Korea\" even before truth about the case was probed. The investigation was led by it in that direction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. reaction to the recent sinking of the warship was so excessive as to sound strange. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the publication of the \"results of investigation\" the U.S. zealously egged the puppet authorities on to adopt a high-handed policy of confrontation, jabbering that they are \"considerably trustworthy\" and that it extends full support to the publication of their claim that the warship was \"sunken by a torpedo attack of the north.\" It styled itself a guardian of the Lee Myung Bak conservative group, terming the case as somebody's \"act of aggression\" and \"challenge\" to international peace and security. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the \"results of investigation\" were announced than the U.S. issued a statement in support of them. In the wake of traitor Lee Myung Bak's issue of \"statement to the people,\" high-ranking officials of Washington vied with each other in clarifying their stand for \"policy cooperation\" and \"maintenance of cooperation.\" Ill-famed tricksters of the Departments of State and Defense and the CIA put their heads together to jointly orchestrate a new farce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 25, a spokesman for the National Security Council of the U.S. blustered that north Korea should admit its attack on warship \"Cheonan\" and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations made no scruple of making such reckless remarks as seriously misjudging the trend of the present situation by uttering that measures for all-out confrontation with fellow countrymen made public by the south Korean puppet authorities were appropriate in view of the situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Command of the 8th U.S. imperialist aggressor army in south Korea has kept itself fully ready for aggression on the DPRK in order to act a \"command of conducting war.\" The commander of the U.S. naval force in south Korea was closeted with the chief of the general staff of the south Korean puppet navy over the issues of staging a joint anti-submarine exercise within the next month and \"maneuvers for intercepting ships in waters within the framework of the PSI\" within the latter half of this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration is using the above-said case for stirring up the atmosphere of \"international cooperation\" through the increased role of south Korea as its servant for the purposes of escalating instability in the Asia-Pacific region, containing big powers and emerging unchallenged in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the ulterior motive of the U.S. acting a strong guardian of the south Korean puppet regime in the warship case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile actions taken by the U.S. after the occurrence of the case are a wanton encroachment upon the DPRK's fundamental interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to behave itself, mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by its actions."

The vessel had remained under the salt water, washed up by strong currents, for many days. Its survivals said they had no smell of powder when the vessel was being sunken. And fishermen testified that they saw no fish or seaweed floated dead by a strong explosion on the spot. Such facts are enough to excite public doubts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spot has often been used as a theater of target practices by the south Korean puppet navy and marine corps with such guns as K-9 and KH-179 howitzers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A member of the \"civilian-military joint investigation team\" said that it may be possible to find out a sign of powder under the water as the spot is a fixed theatre of the gun firing, but if the vessel was broken into two by an explosion 6-9 meters deep under the water, not by a direct hit, it is nonsense to allege that a sign of powder was detected from the funnel or hull of the vessel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also said if the allegation is true, the undersurface of the vessel should have been thickly coated with powder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"investigation team\", finding no word to answer to a question whether the detected powder was compared with that used by south Korea, categorically alleged it is the north's. As experts view, the analysis of \"the powder amount as small as one ten billionth gramme is hardly authentic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"evidence\", which can be invented only by those rabid in anti-north confrontation and plots, could not be used in the final investigation results for fear that it would be rejected by the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same holds true for \"another piece of evidence\" offered by the \"investigation team\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime had combed the area 500 meters around the spot to find out remnants since the incident occurred.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After many days, however, it suddenly announced that \"alloy fragments\" crucial for the probe into the incident were found out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said that the fragments were proved to be alloy of aluminium and magnesium, both used in making torpedo's outer cover, and that they are the same with the material of the north's practice torpedo the south side obtained seven years ago, evidencing the \"north's torpedo attack\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Admittedly, aluminium and magnesium are used in diverse fields. They were apparently used in building the submerged vessel, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strangely enough, the metal fragments were confirmed to be the \"north's\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many doubts have also arisen as regards the afterbody of the torpedo, allegedly found out in the water under the spot of the incident prior to the announcement of the \"investigation results\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime, citing it as \"another crucial piece of evidence\", has asserted that the afterbody with five propellers, engine, control device and driving shaft left undamaged is the same in size, shape and composition with CHT-02D torpedo design in the north's pamphlet introducing its \"weapons for export\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDoes the assertion really sound reasonable?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the bow and stern of the vessel, as heavy as hundreds of tons, were tossed about by currents and six of its crew reported missing because their bodies have not yet been found out. Such being the case, it is unimaginable that the 1.5-meter-long afterbody of the torpedo remained in the same place for some 50 days and that a fishing boat pulled up with a fish net the afterbody scores of U.S. and south Korean warships equipped with up-to-date detection devices had failed to find out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime has offered even photos in a bid to justify its assertion but they only reveal that it is a lie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Besides, the assertion that the screw shaft and engine remained undamaged and unchanged in shape is also a laughing shock. Even U.S. and British members of the international investigation team, which had blindly backed the south Korean regime in its \"investigation\", were perplexed at the exhibit in a glass box.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It lacks logic to include detailed torpedo designs considered top-secret in pamphlets available in other countries. It is the view of experts that the vessel's broken edges by non-contact explosion cannot be the same in corrosion with the torpedo severely heated by self- explosion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"No. 1\" written in the rear part of the screw in the \"writing style of the north\" is what the south Korean regime has produced as the \"clearest piece of evidence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a matter of common sense to leave no clue in stealthy attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even south Korean experts, with doubt that the north left such a clue, are of the view that the number of the screw that allegedly remained unerased under the water for many days was not carved by a machine but handwritten with a blue felt-tip pen apparently some time ago.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also say the north's style of marking number in military equipment is quite different from that produced by the south side as \"evidence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"evidence\" is so poor that south Koreans ridicule it, saying, \"The north is very kind to write the letters in the part unapt to rust,\" \"Blue bus No. 1 on the street is what infiltrated the south from the north\", \"The letters are similar with those of my 8-year-old nephew. Then is my nephew also a spy?\" and \"Anyone who votes for No. 1 (the number of the Grand National Party in elections to local self-governing bodies) is a traitor\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is true for the north's submarine infiltration route offered by the south Korean regime as \"another piece of evidence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"civilian-military joint investigation team\" announced that the submarine left its base at night three days before the occurrence of the incident, approached \"Cheonan\" after making a channel detour in the open sea, attacked the vessel and went back through the same course.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Encountering the demand for a detailed explanation, however, it said it is difficult for any countries to track submarine's underwater movement so that the infiltration and returning course of the north's submarine could not be confirmed.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asked how a small submarine with some 300kg torpedo could hit the 1 400t vessel at a stroke with a 1.7t torpedo in the West Sea where the underwater topography is so complicated and objects can hardly be recognized even within ten meters, the \"investigation team\" answered that it might be possible if the submarine underwent a training beforehand in similar water. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spot of the incident is in the troubled water of the north and the south of Korea where the south side has allegedly maintained alert posture with many detecting and monitoring systems. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, when the vessel met a mishap, the \"Foal Eagle\" joint military maneuvers were at their height with flotillas of various naval vessels and underwater and aerial reconnaissance means mobilized in anti-warship, anti-submarine, anti-air, sea lane blocking and other operations\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the investigation team\", just visualizing the infiltration course of the \"north's submarine\", invented the \"channel course\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the \"investigation results\", south Korean press have said that they should have been worked out in an exact and certain way so that they could never be faulted by others but they were made with imagination in such a way as incriminating the north without grounds, only to amplify doubts. They have also said that it is not only \"Cheonan\" but public trust in the Lee Myung Bak regime that was sunken, that the incident has aroused more and more doubts and deepened mistrust and that if someone makes public a declaration of conscience in the future, the regime will surely face a miserable fate for its fabrication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only too natural that progressive media of south Korea decided to form a committee to verify the \"investigation results\" made public by the south Korean regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the facts show, the \"crucial pieces of evidence\" produced by the south Korean regime, a master of fabrication and concoction, are nothing but faked things from A to Z, inviting serious doubts.

Por lo tanto, esta claro el resultado de esa labor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, el \"grupo internacional de investigacion conjunta\" estaba compuesto por los paises, incluido EE.UU., que no pueden hacer la averiguacion objetiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es la nacion que no elimina todavia las relaciones beligerantes sino tiene las hostiles con la RPDC. Gran Bretana, Australia, Canada y otros paises involucrados en ella son los paises participantes en la guerra coreana persiguiendo al imperio y cooperan con las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?En que lado pondrian y cual conclusion tomaran los miembros enviados de esos paises? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs igual tambien el caso del \"grupo de investigacion conjunta de civiles y militares\" que desde antes de salir el resultado de averiguacion simpatizo con la teoria de \"relacion del Norte\" difundida por las autoridades surcoreanas y se esforzo de todos los modos por relacionar los \"testimonios materiales\" presentados, con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos civiles participantes en ese grupo realizaron actividades limitadas como si hicieran una vida carcelaria en el buque \"Tokdo\" de la marina surcoreana de guerra al ser aislados estrictamente del mundo exterior desde el comienzo de su trabajo y no pudieron participar ni siquiera en la averiguacion principal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, por la culpa de haber presentado la insistencia contraria al \"Ministerio de Defensa Nacional\" fueron expulsados del citado grupo y acusados a la fiscalia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl cabo de cambiarse varias veces el resultado de averiguacion fue falsificado para enfocarse paulatinamente a la teoria del \"ataque de torpedo del Norte\", lo cual demuestra el caracter no cientifico y el no objetivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFueron cambiados en varias veces el tiempo y el lugar del accidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al principio, las autoridades surcoreanas publicaron que el tiempo de surgimiento del caso fueron las 21:45 y despues, las 21:16 cambiandose en varias ocasiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tambien, el lugar del hundimiento del buque fue definido como la cercania de la isla Paekryong donde hay muchos escollos y despues otro lugar donde no hay escollos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto partio del proposito intencional para sacar la conclusion de que el buque no fue hundido por haberse chocado con la roca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Fueron cambiadas repetidamente las insistencias en cuanto al problema sobre la \"provocacion externa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El capitan del \"Cheonan\", que puede ser el testigo firme en el citado caso, dijo al principio que \"no hubo ninguna provocacion externa\" y despues lo cambio con \"si\" corrigendo su pronunciacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El mismo circulo militar surcoreano insistio al principio en que \"no hay ningun fundamento del ataque del Norte\" y al final cambio esta posicion con el accidente por el \"ataque de torpedo del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tambien, hablo de que no hay testigos que vieron la columna de agua surgida por la explosion del buque incluyendo los sobrevivientes del caso del \"Cheonan\" y despues hizo que un soldado de vigilancia en la isla Paekryong muy apartada del lugar de hundimiento haya declarado que habia visto la columna blanca de agua de 100 metros de alto en la oscuridad tensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todo esto fue el vil drama de la banda traidora para relacionar el presente caso con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Son incontables tales datos de prueba.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, negamos totalmente y condenamos resueltamente el \"resultado de investigacion\" de la parte surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segundo, la falsificacion de la teoria sobre el \"ataque del torpedo del Norte\", la comprueban claramente los mismos \"testimonios\" presentados por las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al respecto, el primer coronel del EPC Ri Son Gwon, funcionario del departamento politico del CDN, revelo en lo cientifico y con datos el caracter enganoso del caso analizando uno tras otro los \"testimonios materiales\" presentados por la parte surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, quien se beneficia de este \"caso de hundimiento\" en el Norte y el Sur, dijo Pak y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC llama a todo el ejercito y todo el pueblo a la creacion de grandes innovaciones y saltos para construir la gran potencia prospera socialista con motivo del historico ano 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  ?Por que destruyera por sorpresa la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\" la RPDC que moviliza todas las fuerzas presentando la gran meta?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este caso sensacional necesito solo para la banda traidora surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En cuanto a los verdaderos propositos de esta el revelo como siguiente:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Primero, es para justificar sus maniobras anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta politica del actual gobierno surcoreano es, en una palabra, negar totalmente la reconciliacion, la unidad, la colaboracion y el intercambio que se habian realizado en el pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A la larga, persigue destruir totalmente la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, programa de implementacion de la primera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Con ello, las relaciones Norte-Sur llegaron al borde de la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es explosiva la protesta de la poblacion surcoreana al  respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, a las autoridades surcoreanas les necesitaba el caso de hundimiento del buque de guerra por el \"ataque del torpedo del Norte\" para difundir ampliamente entre los habitantes surcoreanos la opinion publica de que la RPDC no es connacional sino el \"enemigo principal\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, es para justificar la politica exterior en la crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun el acuerdo ya establecido entre EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas, debe traspasarse en 2012 el \"control de mando de las operaciones en el tiempo de guerra\" al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si se realiza este acuerdo, se eliminara el pretexto de ocupacion de las tropas norteamericanas en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto dara un golpe demoledor a las autoridades surcoreanas que toman por la principal politica exterior \"ser omnipotente la Alianza Sur de Corea-EE.UU.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  De ahi que las autoridades surcoreanas intentan manipular el citado caso por el \"ataque de las fuerzas armadas\" de la RPDC y esculpir al relieve la \"seguridad inestable\" de que posibilita estallar la guerra en cualquier momento en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tercero, es para agrupar a las fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, estas fuerzas se van desmembrando.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto deviene un quebradero de cabeza para las actuales autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, estas difunden el incidente del hundimiento del barco \"Cheonan\" como el \"ataque de torpedo del Norte\" e inculcan la confrontacion con la RPDC para agrupar a todas las fuerzas conservadoras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuarto, es para efectuar sin dificultad las elecciones locales inminentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las autoridades surcoreanas, al relacionar obstinadamente con la RPDC el presente \"incidente de hundimiento\" por conducto de los belicistas de la capa militar, maniobran para agravar la tension y fomentar la confrontacion  para asi crear la fase favorable para que sean elegidos sus compinches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Quinto, es para evitar la responsabilidad del incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es muy evidente que si se revela que este accidente se debe al mismo descuidado o al \"envejecimiento\" del buque, la responsabilidad caera enteramente al comandante general del ejercito y a los cabecillas de la capa militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, para mantener sus vidas es preciso falsear el caso como el accidente por el ataque de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La desenfrenada campana conflictiva con la RPDC pretextada con el incidente del \"Cheonan\" significa abierta declaracion de guerra a esta, un crimen sumamente grave que lleva las relaciones N-S al estado de guerra y un acto suicida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta ahora, la RPDC vino fortaleciendo su disuasivo nuclear bajo la bandera del Songun con el fin de hacer frente a la situacion tan aguda como hoy. El arma nuclear y otros potentes medios fisicos de la RPDC no son para ser exhibidos ni conservados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora es cuando debemos demostrar el temperamento de nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl desenvolvimiento de la situacion en el futuro depende enteramente de la actitud de la banda traidora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFinalmente, bajo la autorizacion del CDN de la RPDC, Pak Rim Su volvio a anunciar las importantes medidas tomadas por el EPC y expuso solemnemente la posicion de principios del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea de responder de manera rotunda a la banda de traidores surcoreanos si ella actua imprudentemente acusando atrevidamente a la muy digna RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la entrevista hubo preguntas."

Eso es porque esta banda confia en algo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos actuan imprudentemente acusando atrevidamente a la RPDC del \"criminal\" y declarando publicamente la \"venganza\" y la provocacion de la \"guerra\", lo cual es una cosa que no se puede imaginar al margen del amparo y estimulo de su amo yanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Detras del caso del \"Cheonan\" esta el sombrero de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La invencion del caso y el \"resultado de la investigacion\"  sobre el particular se manipularon de cabo a rabo bajo la aprobacion y amparo de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU., que desde el principio estaba en posicion de dirigirlo, se empeno por hostilizar a Corea en la \"averiguacion conjunta\" y, antes de esclarecerse la verdad del caso, califico a la RPDC del \"sospechoso\" y condujo en esta direccion la investigacion del caso diciendo que \"no hay otro criminal que el Norte de Corea\", \"la causa del hundimiento del buque reside estrictamente en el ataque de torpedo de este\", etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el periodo posterior a la publicacion del \"resultado de investigacion\" del caso, EE.UU. azuzo activamente a los titeres surcoreanos al enfrentamiento intransigente diciendo que tal publicacion \"tiene sentimiento de suma confianza\" y envia el \"apoyo total\" al anuncio sobre el \"ataque del torpedo norcoreano\". Tambien, definio el citado caso como \"acto de agresion\" de alguien y se autodenomino como padrino de la banda conservadora de Lee Myung Bak hablando del \"desafio a la paz y seguridad internacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como fue publicado ese \"resultado\", hizo publica la declaracion de apoyo al respecto y luego de ser publicada la \"declaracion al pueblo\" del traidor Lee Myung Bak expuso oficialmente la posicion de \"cooperacion politica\" y de \"mantenimiento de colaboracion\". Y escenifica la nueva farsa movilizando los conciliabulos con los infames intrigantes del Departamento de Estado, el Departamento de Defensa y la Agencia Central de Inteligencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU. declaro el dia 25 que \"el Norte debe aceptar el hecho relacionado con el ataque al buque 'Cheonan'\" y el embajador norteamericano ante la ONU dijo que son \"convenientes\" a la situacion las medidas de enfrentamiento fratricida tomadas por los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa comandancia del octavo ejercito norteamericano ocupante del Sur de Corea esta plenamente dispuesta a invadir a la RPDC segun su conversion en la \"comandancia del cumplimiento de la guerra\", y el comandante de la marina de guerra norteamericana ocupante del Sur de Corea discutio con el jefe de Estado Mayor de las fuerzas navales del ejercito titere surcoreano el problema de desarrollar en el mes proximo el ejercicio conjunto antisubmarino y en la segunda mitad de este ano el \"ejercicio de bloqueo maritimo interno y externo para la Iniciativa de No Proliferacion de las Armas de Exterminio Masivo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando este caso la administracion Obama trata de usar como su lacayo la camarilla titere del Sur de Corea para ampliar la inestabilidad de la region del Asia y Pacifico y fomenta mas el ambiente de \"cooperacion internacional\" partiendo de su ambicion de mantener a raya a otras potencias y tomar heguemonia de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto deviene precisamente la razon verdadera por la cual EE.UU. se porta como padrino activo de los titeres surcoreanos en el caso de hundimiento del buque de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los actos hostiles, que EE.UU. toma despues del citado caso, resultan innegables danos a los intereses fundamentales de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia teniendo presente de las graves consecuencias que emanen de tales actos."

            "content": "Articulo del comentarista militar sobre el caso de \"Cheonan\" (1a parte)\r\nPyongyang, 28 de mayo (ATCC) -- Se dio a la publicidad el dia 25 el articulo del comentarista de asuntos militares que desmiente el rumor de \"ataque torpedero del Norte\" contra el buque de la marina de guerra surcoreana \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t  La Agencia Telegrafica Central de Corea transmite desde hoy el texto integro del articulo en espanol:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Frente a las tentativas de la camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak de incurrir en acciones aventureras contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea pretextando el rumor de \"ataque torpedero del Norte\" contra el buque de guerra de las fuerzas navales titeres surcoreanas \"Cheonan\", inventado por si misma, el portavoz del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC expuso solemnemente al exterior y al interior del pais la posicion de principios del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Igualmente, puesto que la camarilla surcoreana atribuyo definitivamente el hundimiento del \"Cheonan\" al ataque torpedero de la RPDC, el CDN anuncio la decision de enviar al lugar de los hechos en el Sur de Corea su grupo de inspeccion para verificar y comprobar directamente las \"pruebas materiales\" de ello.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, por su temor a la revelacion de la verdad, la camarilla traidora surcoreana rechaza obstinadamente la averiguacion en el terreno de nuestro grupo de inspeccion presentando alegatos contradictorios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pensabamos que no valia la pena hacer comentarios al respecto porque ese rumor fue tan absurdo e intrigante desde el principio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, puesto que la banda de traidores surcoreanos no quiso escuchar nuestra justa demanda aplaudida por todo el mundo, nos vimos obligados a revelar la verdad del incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1.  El rumor de \"ataque torpedero del Norte\" es un invento de la camarilla de traidores surcoreanos\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　A las 9 p.m. del 26 de marzo, en las aguas del Mar Oeste de Corea cercanas a las islas Paekryong y Taechong quedo hundido el buque de la marina de guerra surcoreana \"Cheonan\" dividiendose en dos partes por una causa desconocida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A mas de 50 dias de ese tragico incidente, o sea, el pasado 20 de mayo, la camarilla surcoreana publico el llamado \"reporte del resultado de investigacion conjunta\", en el cual divulgo a todo el mundo el polemico rumor que busca en el ataque torpedero de nuestro pais la causa de hundimiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este rumor tan absurdo fue inventado ya al principio del incidente por la camarilla surcoreana vinculandolo sin fundamentos con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo comprueban las \"pruebas materiales\" presentadas hasta ahora por el \"grupo de investigacion conjunta\" bajo el control trasero de la camarilla surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Primero, veamos la \"composicion de la minima cantidad de polvora\" que segun ese grupo, ha sido recogida en la chimenea y el corte del casco del buque siniestrado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La camarilla de traidores surcoreanos supuso que el accidente fue causado por el ataque torpedero del Norte porque la polvora recogida es la dinamita de alta potencia RDX que se usa en el torpedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  RDX es la dinamita cristalina blanca y anhidra que hoy se usa generalmente en la industria belica y las otras ramas industriales de todos los paises del mundo, inclusive el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, resulta absurdo vincular el uso de esa dinamita con nuestro torpedo y mucho mas ridiculo considerarlo como la causa directa de hundimiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es dificil creer que la polvora haya sido \"extraida\" del casco y la chimenea del buque hundido, si se toma en cuenta que estos objetos se mantuvieron sumergidos por decenas de dias en la zona del accidente donde hay una corriente muy brava y las aguas son muy saladas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las sospechas se hacen mas grandes cuando escuchamos los testimonios de los supervivientes y los pescadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los primeros confesaron que no han olido a ninguna polvora en el momento de hundimiento y los segundos declararon que no vieron en el lugar de los hechos ni un solo pez ni una planta de cultivo artificial flotando en la superficie del agua muertos por la explosion de la dinamita de alta potencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las fuerzas navales y el cuerpo de marines del ejercito titere surcoreano realizan a menudo en la zona del accidente el tiro de combate de la artilleria, incluyendo de los canones de tiro parabolico \"K-9\" y \"KH-179\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Un miembro del \"grupo de investigacion conjunta de civiles y militares\" del Sur de Corea sostuvo que es posible el hallazgo de la sustancia de polvora en el mar porque la zona del siniestro es el area fija de ejercicio de artilleria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, -continuo- resulta ilogico que la polvora haya sido recogida de la chimenea en la cubierta y el corte del casco de buque, si se supone que el buque no ha recibido impacto directo y se partio en dos a causa de la explosion que tuvo lugar en una profundidad 6-9 metros mas abajo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para que se haga posible la recogida de la polvora en dichas partes, el fondo del casco debe ser \"cargado totalmente de la polvora\", afirmo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Incredulo de que la \"minima cantidad de la polvora\" fuera del \"Norte\", uno pregunto a la camarilla de traidores surcoreanos si la habian comparado con la polvora que usa actualmente el ejercito surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al cabo de quedarse un rato sin saber como responder, la camarilla impuso obstinadamente su mentira poniendo un ejemplo de \"huellas digitales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como opinan los especialistas, ?como es posible creer en el analisis de la \"composicion de ese 0.0000000001 gramo de la polvora recogida\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, decimos que la camarilla de traidores surcoreanos esta loca por la confrontacion y la campana intrigante contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si bien la camarilla trato de usar en su complot el resultado de ese analisis, no pudo mencionarlo siguiera cuando publicaba el resultado final de investigacion por su temor al repudio de la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pasemos ahora a otra \"prueba material\": los \"pedazos de la aleacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desde que sucedio el incidente, la camarilla surcoreana peino la zona maritima dentro de 500 metros desde el punto del accidente para \"recoger los restos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Muchos dias despues, los titeres anunciaron de repente el hallazgo de \"unos pedazos de aleacion\" que hacen mucha falta para esclarecer la causa del siniestro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun ellos, estos pedazos se componian de aluminio y magnesio que forman la parte exterior de torpedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Insistieron en que los pedazos son los mismos que los componentes del \"torpedo norcoreano para el ejercicio adquirido hace 7 anos\" y por esta razon, constituyen la \"prueba material\" que confirma el \"ataque torpedero del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como conoce todo el mundo, son multiples los usos de aluminio y magnesio. Estos metales fueron utilizados tambien en la construccion del buque hundido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, esos \"pedazos de aleacion\" han sido confirmados al fin como \"los del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta llena de incognitas tambien la otra \"prueba material\" determinante al decir de los titeres surcoreanos: la parte trasera del torpedo de 1.5 metros de largo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ellos dicen que la encontraron por \"sorpresa\" en la zona de accidente poco antes de la publicacion del resultado de investigacion del 20 de mayo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Detallan que en la parte trasera se conservan intactos 5 helices de rotacion normal e inversa, el motor de propulsion, el aparato de control y el eje de operacion y anaden que el tamano, la forma y la composicion de ellos encajan en el diseno del torpedo CHT-02D, que aparece en el \"folleto de presentacion de armas del Norte para la exportacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sacan la conclusion de que la parte trasera encontrada es un resto del torpedo norcoreano que hundio el barco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Otro embuste mas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es imposible que no fuera desplazado de su lugar durante mas de 50 dias la parte propulsora del torpedo, ya que han sido arrastrados por la corriente brava del Mar Oeste la proa y la popa del buque \"Cheonan\", que pesan cientos de toneladas, y los restos mortales de 6 marineros desaparecidos y calificados finalmente de \"caidos en el combate\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ademas, fue una embarcacion civil la que extrajo con una red de pescar esa parte de torpedo de 1.5 metros de largo que no pudieron encontrar durante mas de 50 dias decenas de buques norteamericanos y surcoreanos dotados de sofisticados medios de sonda capaces de hallar hasta el mini-fragmento de obuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es una comedia que se puede ver solo en las fabulas de Aesop.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para dar credito a esa marana, los traidores surcoreanos presentaron unas \"fotos de prueba\" que solo probaron que la busqueda de esa parte de torpedo es una farsa orquestada de antemano por ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Causo la risa burlona de los hombres el hecho de que no se vieron doblados ni afectados el ciguenal del eje propulsor y el motor del torpedo que supuestamente partio en dos el \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hasta los miembros estadounidenses y britanicos del grupo de investigacion, que actuaban con el favoritismo a los titeres surcoreanos, se pusieron colorados cuando vieron esa prueba exhibida en un mostrador de vidrio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta claro que nadie va a presentar en detalles en un folleto normal para la circulacion en el extranjero el diseno del torpedo a usar en supersecreto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los especialistas coinciden en que no pueden ser iguales el grado de corrosion del corte de la armadura del buque partido a la mitad a causa de la explosion a distancia y el del torpedo calentado sobremanera por la explosion interna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo mas ridiculo del caso es que la \"prueba mas clara\" es la letra \"1 pon\" (sufijo que significa el numero) escrita al \"estilo caligrafico del Norte de Corea\" en la cola de la parte propulsora del torpedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es una referencia elemental no dejar huellas cuando se planea un ataque sigiloso contra la contraparte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al ver esa letra, no estampada a maquina sino escrita a mano con una pluma que escribe en azul, se mantiene tan clara como si fuera acabadita de escribir si bien la parte propulsora del torpedo estuvo sumergida durante decenas de dias, hasta los especialistas surcoreanos de renombre ironizaron a la camarilla de traidores por haber manipulado tan torpemente el caso diciendo asi: \"supongamos la mas minima posibilidad del ataque torpedero del Norte, entonces, ?como es posible que este haya dejado asi esa prueba?\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Murmuran que si la camarilla quiso hacer creer que ese resto perteneciera al torpedo norcoreano, porque habra anotado la letra \"1 pon\" si el Norte usa otro sufijo ordinal \"ho\" en sus equipos militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta letra-prueba tan absurda hizo circular en el Sur de Corea las siguientes frases nuevas: \"El muy amable Norte dejo su letra en la parte inoxidable\", \"El bus azul ´1 pon´ que circula por la calle es de fabricacion norcoreana para el Sur\", \"La letra de mi sobrino de 8 anos de edad es igual a la del Norte. Entonces, ?no sera el acaso un agente del Norte?\" y \"Sere un traidor si voto por el ´1 pon´ que hundio el buque ´Cheonan´\" (por casualidad, este numero representa ahora al gobernante \"Gran Partido Nacional\" del Sur de Corea en las \"elecciones locales\").\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Analicemos ahora la otra prueba que es la ruta de penetracion del pequeno submarino del Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El \"grupo de investigacion conjunta de civiles y militares\" publico que nuestro submarino partio de noche de su base 3 dias antes del incidente, se acerco al buque \"Cheonan\" dando rodeos en forma de U en alta mar y regreso por la misma ruta despues de ataque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando pidieron las explicaciones detalladas al respecto, reconocio que es dificil para cualquier pais del mundo confirmar el trayecto debajo del mar de los submarinos pequenos y no pudo precisar la ruta de penetracion y regreso de uno norcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando se formulo esta pregunta \"El ambiente submarino del Mar Oeste es muy complicado y en el no se puede distinguir los objetos ni a la distancia de 10 metros mas o menos. Pues, ?como es posible que el pequeno submarino disenado para cargar un torpedo ligero de 300 kg aproximadamente haya traido el torpedo pesado de 1.7 toneladas y hundido con este de un \"ataque\" el buque \"Cheonan\" de mil 400 toneladas?, el grupo de investigacion se limito a balbucear que es posible si lo ejercita en las aguas de condiciones similares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La zona de hundimiento esta en litigio entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La camarilla de traidores se ufanaba que sus fuerzas se mantienen ahi en alerta y operan un doble y triple sistema de deteccion y vigilancia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ademas, cuando sucedio el caso, se libraba ahi al climax el ejercicio militar conjunto \"Aguilucho\" y formaban un hormiguero los buques y medios de espionaje submarino y aereo movilizados en las operaciones contra buques y submarinos y de interceptacion maritima y el ejercicio de fuego antiaereo, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A pesar de esto, los titeres inventaron esa ruta en U a base de mera hipotesis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No por casualidad, los medios de prensa surcoreanos trascienden que el publicado resultado de investigacion solo sirve para ampliar las sospechas porque se basa en las suposiciones tan simples como \"?Quien sera si no fue el Norte?\", lejos de ser irrefutablemente exacto y preciso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Continuan que lo que fue hundido esta vez no es solo el \"Cheonan\" sino tambien la confianza en el \"poder MB\" (Lee Myung Bak) y que el incidente resulta cada vez mas sospechoso e incredulo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Criticaron directamente al \"poder MB\" sosteniendo que este tergiversa el caso a su conveniencia ocultando la verdad con fraudes y preguntando como sera su destino si alguien, que sepa la verdad del caso, hiciera la \"declaracion de conciencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es muy natural que los progresistas medios de prensa del Sur de Corea hayan organizado para esclarecer la verdad el \"comite de verificacion\" sobre ese \"resultado\" plagado de sospechas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como hemos visto, las \"pruebas materiales determinantes\" presentadas por la banda de traidores, grandes maestros en inventar y urdir el complot, son de punta a cabo serios interrogantes."
