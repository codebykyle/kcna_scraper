These traitorous and unethical crimes can never be pardoned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The biggest crime committed by Park is that she malignantly slandered the social system and the dignity of the DPRK and kicked up the racket of confrontation, thereby pushing the north-south ties into the lowest ebb.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in her office, Park revealed her confrontational nature through the \"story of nuclear threat from the north\". In March 2013 when the DPRK advanced the line on simultaneously developing the economic construction and the building of nuclear force, she took the lead in malignantly slandering it and has ever since continued vicious outpourings against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She has so far let loose on more than 350 occasions coarse invectives slandering the social system and dignity of the DPRK since she took office. This is something unprecedented in the history of the successive puppet regimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park, kicking up the racket of \"human rights in the north\" and anti-DPRK leaflet-scattering, set it as the aim of her \"north policy\" to achieve the \"reunification under liberal democracy\" and has openly pursued confrontation of social systems. Typical of this was \"great opportunity for unification\" and \"getting ready for reunification\" much touted by her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another crime committed by Park is that she hurt the sovereignty and the dignity of the nation through her despicable sycophancy and treachery and brought the danger of a nuclear war by staging DPRK-targeted war drills together with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She left OPECON entirely to the tender mercy of the U.S. and squandered a colossal amount of money collected from the people as taxes for the purchase of American weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's servile attitude was also manifested in her approach to her Japanese master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park let pro-Japanese hack writers who had the history textbooks embellishing the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea passed through screening hold important posts related to history including chairman of the committee for compiling national history book. Far from protesting against the moves of the Japanese reactionaries to revive militarism and launch reinvasion, she got zealous in kowtowing to them and conspiring with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park zealously followed the strategy of Washington for establishing military hegemony over Northeast Asia through mad-cap north-targeted nuclear war drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For a little over 2 years in office her regime staged more than 90 north-targeted war drills of various forms in league with the U.S. Those war rehearsals assumed extremely provocative nature as they were aimed at \"making preemptive surprise strike\", \"striking bases\" and \"occupying Pyongyang.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since Park took power, the ill-famed \"yusin\" fascist dictatorship has been revived in all fields of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park suppressed the political dissident forces, progressive forces of different strata.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is now getting desperate in fascist violence in a bid to tide over her serious ruling crisis, a result of her crimes against the nation and misrule by enforcing the harshest rule under the pretence of security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crimes perpetrated by her in less than two years and a half of her office are the most disgraceful ones surpassing the ones committed by former dictators in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is, indeed, shame on the Korean nation, its tragedy and a source of trouble.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now matter how desperately she works to cover up her crimes against reunification, nation and people and prolong her remaining days, she can never conceal the crimes she perpetrated against the nation by escalating the confrontation with compatriots in the north, committing acts of treachery and spearheading north-targeted war drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history and nation will never pardon the thrice-cursed crimes committed by Park against the aspiration of all Koreans and the trend of the times but certainly settle accounts with her."
