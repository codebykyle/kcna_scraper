This is an extremely hideous crime that may trigger off fresh arms race and nuclear arms buildup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a height of artifice to mislead the public opinion for the U.S. to talk about \"a world without nuclear weapons\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is most important for denuclearizing the world is to denuclearize the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when all the nuclear weapons of the U.S. are dismantled and when it drops its attempt at aggression of other countries, can the world be in peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is self-evident that the international movement will be intensified to cope with the U.S. threat and blackmail with nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more foolish than to think about the denuclearization of the world before the U.S. is denuclearized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nothing but a ridiculous political charade for the U.S. to cry out for denuclearization and nuclear non-proliferation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the world can never come true as long as the U.S. pursues the modernization of nuclear weapons."
