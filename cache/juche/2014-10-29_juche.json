            "content": "ACNC califica a autoridades surcoreanas de sirvientes de guerra de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 29 de octubre (ACNC) -- En la reunion consultiva anual de seguridad (SCM) Sur de Corea-Estados Unidos, efectuada el dia 24 en Washington, ambas partes acordaron prolongar por tiempo indefinido el periodo de traspaso del mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\tEste crimen antinacional revela la intencion de las autoridades surcoreanas de perpetuar la ocupacion y la dominacion colonial de EE.UU. sobre el suelo surcoreano, intensificar la confrontacion fratricida y las maniobras belicas contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa soberania militar es uno de los mas importantes indices para el ejercicio de soberania nacional. Y es natural que la agravacion de avasallamiento militar aumente la subyugacion politica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde la fundacion del ejercito mercenario colonial del Sur de Corea hasta la fecha el poder de mando supremo sobre el ejercito del Sur de Corea lo ejerce EE.UU. en virtud de los leoninos tratados militares impuestos por el este imperio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa poblacion surcoreana lucho durante mucho tiempo por el traspaso del mando militar y consiguio la promesa de rescatarlo hasta 2012. Pero, el traidor Lee Myung Bak lo prolongo hasta 2015 y el actual gobierno titere, no satisfecho con esto, lo dilato por tiempo indefinido despues de 2020. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora los titeres surcoreanos insisten en promover el traspaso de mando militar tomando como promesa la eliminacion de \"amenaza nuclear y de misiles del Norte\", lo cual es una burla a la poblacion surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea establecieron distintos sistemas y tramitaciones para tomar el mando de operaciones en tiempo de guerra y controlar las operaciones del ejercito titere surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. sistematiza la intervencion en las politicas militares del Sur de Corea mediante la convocacion del SCM y la Comision Militar como aparatos administrativos para realizar la politica y estrategia militares sobre la Peninsula Coreana y resolver diversos problemas practicos concernientes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves del SCM y otros satisface sus demandas militares, controla totalmente el ejercito surcoreano por medio de la \"comandancia de las fuerzas combinadas\" e incorpora a los efectivos surcoreanos a sus operaciones militares en ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos reciben de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del suelo surcoreano 70 por ciento de todas sus informaciones estrategicas y tacticas militares y la mayoria de las armas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA precio de haber anulado el traspaso de mando de operaciones en tiempo de guerra, los titeres surcoreanos deben comprar la cantidad astronomica de armas norteamericanas y la poblacion surcoreana debe pagar cada ano enormes gastos para la defensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este mundo no habra otros tontos como los titeres surcoreanos que ofrecen a las fuerzas extranjeras el mando de operaciones militares renunciando hasta la soberania militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa prolongacion  indefinida del periodo de traspaso de mando de operaciones en tiempo de guerra muestra que las autoridades surcoreanas son sirvientes coloniales de EE.UU. que no tienen ni la minima conciencia independiente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben dejar de inmediato su tonteria."
