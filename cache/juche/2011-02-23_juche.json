            "content": "NDC Inspection Group Reveals Truth behind Yonphyong Shelling\r\n Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- The inspection group of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK in the first installment of the statement issued on Nov. 2 last year scientifically and fairly disclosed before the world that the sunk Cheonan ship case was the most hideous conspiratorial case in the history of the nation faked up by the U.S. and the south Korean group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t In the subsequent period, experts of south Korea conducted 11 tests including a precision analysis of the process of the formation of absorptive on the hull of the ship and torpedo parts with the help of a scanning tunneling microscope. These tests led to flatly refuting the investigation results presented by south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shell pieces on which flower-shape white substances are attached were found in the propelling body of the torpedo which was produced as overwhelming evidence proving the ship sinking. This proved that the propelling body had long been under water, not for 1-2 months. The puppet Defence Ministry hastily removed the shell pieces only to become people's laughing stock.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An officer who had been hired for a search operation in the waters where the incident took place was proved to have met death during the rescue operation of a U.S. submarine, increasing the suspicions about the clash between \"Cheonan and the U.S. submarine.\" More facts are being brought to light to probe the truth behind the above-said charade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has already been known that more than 70 percent of the south Koreans said they were skeptical about the \"story about the north's involvement in the Cheonan case\" while the rest do not believe it or remain doubtful about it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK proposed the U.S. and south Korea conducting a joint investigation into the case after bringing relevant evidence to Panmunjom if they can not receive the inspection group of the NDC of the DPRK. But they have not yet responded to this bold and magnanimous proposal. Even a mere child can guess their ulterior motive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the group of traitors of south Korea is making far-fetched assertions in a bid to exploit the already-bankrupt Cheonan case for escalating confrontation with the DPRK. This group is making futile efforts to shift the blame for the Yonphyong Island shelling on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea's delegates walked out of the conference room in the eyes of the north side's delegates when preliminary talks for the high-ranking north-south military talks were held on Feb. 8 and 9. But the south side floated the misinformation that the north side's delegates unilaterally walked out of the conference room. It is clear from this fact that the above-said group may cook up whatever it likes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling was a planned provocation aimed to trigger off a direct military clash against the Korean People's Army through a reckless preemptive attack. Through this the group sought to play down its crime and push the north-south relations to the brink of war as the Cheonan case was branded as a hideous conspiratorial case, making it impossible for it to escape the bitter domestic and foreign public accusation and denunciation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Cheonan case was the initial provocation to put overall military pressure on the DPRK in conspiracy with foreign forces while the Yonphyong shelling was the second planned provocation to ignite a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean group of traitors recorded last year as a year of confrontation and conflict. In the new year, too, it is free to let loose a whole string of reckless remarks falsifying truth, persistently using the two cases for stoking confrontation between fellow countrymen. Under this situation the inspection group of the NDC decided to disclose the truth behind the Yonphyong Island shelling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Truth behind the Yonphyong Island Shelling \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yonphyong Island in the West Sea of Korea covers 6.8 square kilometers and its circumference is about 18 kilometers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This small island has been widely known for the diversity of fishes and their abundance and become an object of envy by foreigners. This island, however, has turned into an advance base for aggression against the DPRK as huge marine corps and artillery forces are deployed by the south Korean puppet warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After amassing huge strike means on five islands in the West Sea of Korea including Yonphyong Island, south Korea watched for an opportunity of provocation while working out a firing plan of artillery pieces and flying corps of the puppet army for the defence of the \"northern limit line.\" But it could not put it into practice in face of the toughest stand taken by the army of the DPRK and strong public opinion inside and outside Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Nov. 22 last year when Hoguk exercises targeted against the DPRK was at its height across south Korea, the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff crafted a plan to bombard the territorial waters of the DPRK side on Nov. 23 and 24 from waters off Yonphyong Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK, prompted by its hope to avert a military conflict in the sensitive waters and preserve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, sent a telephone message to the puppet military at 8:00 on Nov. 23.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The message called for immediately canceling the reckless plan for shelling at the territorial waters of the DPRK side. It also warned in strong terms that in case south Korea defies this, it will face a resolute physical counterattack by the army of the DPRK and that it will be held wholly responsible for all the ensuing consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea, however, opened fire at the territorial waters of the DPRK by mobilizing artillery pieces deployed on Yonphyong Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yonphyong Island, once home to peaceable inhabitants, thus turned into a base for preemptive military provocation and could not escape a deserved punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The merciless physical counterattack on the positions of the puppet army on the island proved once again that the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu did not make an empty declaration when it said that it would never pardon anyone intruding even a bit into the territorial waters and air and territory of the DPRK over which its sovereignty is exercised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no house owner who will allow a robber to go on rampage and no army of any country who will allow warmongers to make a preemptive attack on its inviolable territorial waters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was due to the group of traitors keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen that peaceful waters turned into a theatre of military conflict all of a sudden. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFortunately, more than 1,300 islanders remained unhurt because they all went to the seaside opposite the firing positions to gather shellfishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers, however, went so sordid as to try to beat back the counterstrike by the DPRK by using the inhabitants as \"human shields.\" They even did not inform the inhabitants of the warning message from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for \"civilian casualties\", they were a few civilians enlisted in the armed forces. They were in the barracks of the puppet army. Had they not entered the barracks, they would not have met death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from drawing a due lesson from its piteous plight, the group of traitors opted for expanding the shelling, crying out for so-called \"retaliation\" and \"punishment.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors carried out a massive replacement of military brasshats including the defense minister with hawkish guys and bolstered huge troops of the three services in and around Yonphyong Island. After clamping an emergency alert they fired bullets and shells from the area of the island for more than one hour on Dec. 20.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They secretly changed the waters and targets to be shelled for fear of the second and third counterstrike by the army of the DPRK. They also used the shells that had been left unused during the island shelling incident a month ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK did not feel any need to respond to this clumsy firing conducted by the coward military for a propaganda purpose to save its face. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the group of traitors fired even a shell on the territorial waters of the DPRK side, not only those islands from which shells were fired but also Seoul would have turned to a sea of fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Yonphyong Island Shelling: Extension of Systematic Provocation to DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling was an extension of the military provocations that have been systematically escalated up to this date since the publication of the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After sustaining a bitter defeat in the three-year war aimed to stifle the DPRK in its cradle, the puppet group of south Korea flatly denied the conclusion of the AA and worked in every way to scrap and render it invalid while crying out for \"separate northward advance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These moves were vividly proved by its acts in waters around the five islands in the West Sea on which a maritime military demarcation line was not set at the time of concluding the AA. These islands are geographically close to the coast of the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea tried hard to put its plan of \"separate northward advance\" into practice while committing abduction and murder of peaceable fishermen, armed attacks on the area of the DPRK side and other crimes with the waters around the islands as a springboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military provocations in waters of the West Sea of Korea and other areas were handled as the top agenda item at a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission after the conclusion of the AA. This proves the gravity of the military provocations in these waters at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the south Korean puppet army the waters in the West Sea turned into an advance base for the provocation of a war against the DPRK and a dispute-ridden waters fraught with the constant danger of confrontation and conflict between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea escalated military provocations in the waters even in the 1960s, 70s and 80s in the wake of the 1950s. In the 1990s they developed into military conflicts too dangerous to put under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An example of this was the first West Sea skirmish in June 1999. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time the U.S. and its allies' war against Yugoslavia was drawing to an end. South Korea set the DPRK as a target and the West Sea as an ignition point for the second Korean war. Then it buckled to carrying out the \"operational plan to provoke the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet warmongers of south Korea amassed two large destroyers, 20 clippers, more than 40 combatant ships of various types including tank landing ship, guard ship, supply ship, rescue ship as well as marine corps in waters around Yonphyong Island. They recklessly preempted firing at the ships of the DPRK side on routine guard duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After failing to make the first West Sea skirmish an ignition point for an all-out war, the puppet military warmongers sparked off the second armed conflict in the waters in 2002 when the hot wind of reconciliation and unity swept the peninsula more furiously than before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the subsequent period the puppet forces annually escalated the intrusions into the maritime guard line of the DPRK side in a planned way and triggered the third West Sea skirmish in 2009 only to disclose that they sought to use the waters around Yonphyong Island as an advance base for provoking a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors came to power, the number of intrusions into the territorial waters of the DPRK side sharply increased. Last year alone it infiltrated ships into them on over 600 occasions under the pretext of \"intercepting fishing boats\" or coping with the routine operation of the ships of the navy of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts prove that the Yonphyong Island shelling was by no means an accidental case but a product of protracted confrontation with fellow countrymen incited by the successive puppet warmongers and a direct revelation of the systematic extension of their military provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Criminal Aim Sought by Group of Traitors through Yonphyong Island Shelling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling perpetrated by the south Korean group of traitors was a grave military provocation committed as an extension of the Cheonan case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case faked up by the group by sacrificing innocent soldiers for confrontation with the DPRK on March 26 last year turned out to be more unfavorable to the group as the days go by. The \"results of investigation\", announced by it twice to prove that the case \"was linked with the north,\" were full of doubts, sparking off bitterer ridicule and criticism at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first installment of the statement issued by the NDC inspection group revealing the truth behind the Cheonan case in the eyes of the world brought into bold relief the true colors of the tricksters who faked up the case. The U.S. and the group of traitors found no word to refute it. The tricksters worked hard to seek a way for tiding over the unfavorable situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"bright idea\" that came to the minds of the U.S. and the group of traitors was to fire shells into the waters under the DPRK control in a bid to induce its army to take a countermeasure and drive the north-south relations to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the south Korean group of traitors fired bullets and shells into the waters of the DPRK side despite its repeated strong warnings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors sought a sinister aim in committing shelling from Yonphyong Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shelling was aimed to persistently maintain its stand of preserving the illegal \"northern limit line\", first of all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known to the world that the \"northern limit line\" is a brigandish line unilaterally drawn inside the inviolable waters of the DPRK by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces present in south Korea under the berets of the \"UN forces\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists felt extremely tired after sustaining an unprecedented defeat in the Korean War in July 1953. They let Clark, the then commander of the \"UN forces\", set the NLL, so-called Clark line, in the waters of the West Seat of Korea in a bid to check traitor Syngman Rhee's reckless attempt at \"separate northern expedition\" and prevent a war which might reoccur according to it and, at the same time, bar south Korean fishermen from going to the northern half of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The line is the \"final line for blocking the way to the north\" and the \"limit line for banning the sailing of boats to the north\" unilaterally drawn by Clark, commander of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, to meet the U.S. self-righteous interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Henry Kissinger, U.S. secretary of State in 1975, referring in a diplomatic message to the illegality of the NLL, said that the NLL was unilaterally set and it was not accepted by north Korea. This is in wanton violation of international law as the line was unilaterally drawn in the open sea, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ambassador to south Korea in December 1973 expressed deep concern by claiming that in case an incident occurs in the waters along the NLL, south Korea and the U.S. would be blamed by majority countries for doing wrongs. As seen above, the U.S. and its satellites openly admitted the illegality of the line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why the U.S. imperialists did not inform the DPRK side of the line, far from opening it to the public though many years have passed since then.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The voices ridiculing the NLL as a \"hot potato\" which is poor in logic and serious in practice are endlessly heard from among the political, academic and public circles of south Korea as it was unilaterally set.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the NLL is quite contrary to the Paragraph 13 B of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulating that the island groups of Paengyong-Do, Taechong-Do, Sochong-Do, Yonpyong-Do and U-Do shall remain under the military control of the commander of the \"UN forces\" and all other islands and waters under the military control of the DPRK side. It is in total breach of the norms of maritime boundary stipulated by the International Law of the Sea including the respect for the right to 12 mile territorial waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the NLL been set according to the recognized legal norms and usage, the south Korean group of traitors would not have felt the need to \"preserve\" the line with so much effort. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces preempted shelling from Yonphyong Island where the military confrontation between the north and the south remains acute though south Korea has so many islands. Their real intention was to \"preserve the NLL\" whose existence is at increasing peril day by day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling was also designed to spark off military conflicts in the West Sea of Korea in a bid to nullify the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration, its action program, the precious gains common to the nation, and turn the waters into an eternal theatre of confrontation and conflict.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous aspiration and desire of all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to make the waters of the West Sea of Korea peace waters and ensure the common interests and prosperity of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A lot of cases of military confrontation and clash in the past caused painful casualties and the economic losses, and damages done to fishermen in the north and the south amounted to astronomical figures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The adoption of the historic two declarations, the proposal for setting the special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea for the co-prosperity of the nation and the adoption of an agreement on providing a military guarantee for setting common fishing waters and peace waters reflected the unanimous desire of all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the expectation and hope of the Koreans to see the disputed waters in the West Sea of Korea which brought disgrace and pain of the nation turn into peace and prosperity waters adding to the pride and joy of the nation have not been translated into reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo sooner had traitor Lee Myung Bak, steeped in antagonism toward the DPRK, become the master of \"Chongwadae\" than such hideous policy for confrontation with fellow countrymen as \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" was adopted as a \"state policy.\" He began to scrap the historic north-south agreements which had already been under implementation, blustering that he would approach the north-south relations with a \"ruler of pragmatism\", not with a \"yardstick of ideology.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors totally turned down even the proposal for preventing military confrontation and conflict between the north and the south and ensuring the common interests and prosperity of the nation under the pretext of \"sympathy of the people\" and \"financial burden\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It hatched a sinister plot to eliminate everything step by step after classifying the inter-Korean agreements, the precious gains common to the nation, into a category which should be implemented on a priority basis, a category to be implemented at the final phase and a category which should not be implemented. This drove the implementation of the historic October 4 declaration to a total suspension, brought the north-south relations back to those of confrontation in the era of the Cold War and turned the West Sea again into a theatre of military confrontation and conflict, an advance base for igniting a war against the DPRK and a position from which to start an attack on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, the people in south Korea, commenting on the Yonphyong Island shelling in which the military clash spilled over to the land from the sea, deplored that such tragic incident would not have occurred if the October 4 declaration had been implemented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said shelling was also aimed at plugging the U.S., its master, deeper into its scenario for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After setting it as the primary target to keep the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea for an indefinite period, traitor Lee Myung Bak of south Korea did not hesitate to commit the thrice-cursed treachery to \"tighten the alliance\" with the U.S. But he could not settle the issue of postponing the transfer of the right to control wartime operations as he intended.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was because the decision to hand over the right to control wartime operations to the puppet army till April 17, 2012 according to the south Korea-U.S. \"summit\" in September 2006 was made public to have been officially agreed at the bilateral \"defense ministers talks\" in February 2007.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Driven by the urgent need to create exceptional \"uneasy security\" for the pretext for the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea, the group of traitors was repeatedly closeted, finally cooking up the case of Cheonan warship sinking at night under the territorial waters in peacetime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group staged big joint naval exercises one after another under that pretext and introduced nuclear carrier flotilla of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces into the narrow waters of the West Sea of Korea. It then held renegotiations for postponing the transfer of the right to wartime operation control as it planned and succeeded in extending the hand-over time for additional three years and seven months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enraged people rose up in protest against this pro-American and treacherous act across south Korea. Upset by this, the group of traitors needed the second Cheonan case, i.e. a shocking case to keep the \"uneasy security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling was committed under meticulous plan for this purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to put this plan into practice, the group committed two adventurous military provocations at the time when 2010 was running out. It is misusing the case of Yonphyong Island shelling to escalate confrontation with the DPRK in the new year, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Who was behind the Yonphyong Island shelling?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the group of traitors perpetrated shelling from the Yonphyong Island one after another despite strong protest and denunciation at home and abroad, the attention of the world was focused on the every movement of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces present in south Korea under the mask of the \"UN Command\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was because the U.S. imperialists, the real master of the command holding the right to \"control wartime operations\" in south Korea and tasked to implement and oversee the Korean Armistice Agreement, zealously backed and patronized the military provocations of the puppet forces, far from preventing them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the group announced the plan for second shelling from the island, pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war, the U.S. imperialists let the command fully support the plan, terming the projected exercise one to be staged legitimately in observance of the AA. Moreover, they declared that they would send at least 20 persons belonging to the UN forces to the island to assist the group in such fields as communications and medical care so that it would go ahead with the exercise as planned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this was their sinister aim to paint any military conflict in these sensitive waters as confrontation between the army of the DPRK and the \"UN Command,\" not anything happening between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. imperialists misled public opinion by advertising the military provocation of the group as \"legitimate shelling exercise\" in a bid to make the military conflict between the two sides a fait accompli and get the U.S. aggression forces in south Korea fully ready to involve themselves in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There was no clash between the two sides as the army of the DPRK paid no heed to such vicious military provocation as taking revenge after being hit hard. But the U.S. imperialists staged large-scale joint naval maneuvers after rapidly dispatching \"George Washington\" nuclear carrier flotilla made up of cruisers, destroyers, nuclear submarines, landing craft, etc. dozens of carrier-based aircraft, F-15 and F-16 fighters as main forces to the narrow waters of the West Sea of Korea as they planned. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn succession they sent more than 10,000 troops of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, a nuclear carrier flotilla and over 150 fighters to the waters off Okinawa in Japan to stage the largest-ever joint military exercises in coordinated operations with 34,000 troops of the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\", 40 warships and 250 planes. They even invited south Korean puppet troops to participate in the exercises as \"observers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timing to coincide with this, they invited top class servants of south Korea and Japan to Washington for a confab to discuss \"a joint counter-action\" against the DPRK and \"close cooperation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their military moves in the wake of the Cheonan case and the Yonphyong Island shelling were aimed to wind up the setting up of the structure of military confrontation in Northeast Asia under the pretext of the escalating tension on the peninsula and, furthermore, realize their wild ambition for world domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already disclosed, the U.S. imperialists' Asia-Pacific policy is the core and mainstay of their strategy for world domination in the 21st century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to realize this strategy, they are attaching great importance to the above-said region where big powers are concentrated, to the Korean Peninsula, in particular, as it is of great importance geologically and strategically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is their judgment that it is impossible to dominate the Asian continent nor is it possible to lay a military siege to Eurasia unless the whole of Korea is put under their control. So they calculate that they can easily dominate the world if they seize the Korean Peninsula and overpower the big powers in Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the reality was quite contrary to what they intended. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They ran the whole gamut of means such as economic isolation and suffocation, psychological warfare and military threat to stifle Korean-style socialism. But they suffered repeated setbacks. On the contrary, their influence and right to domination weakened in this region due to their domestic and foreign environment and crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They felt the urgent need to exercise influence backed by military muscle and this required an appropriate justification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence, they instigated the south Korean group of traitors to fabricate the Cheonan case. Later they openly allowed the group to \"take counter-action by exercising the right to self-defense\" and \"amend the rules of belligerency.\"  They egged the group on to perpetrate shelling from Yonphyong Island, even providing \"information about the north\" and giving prompt support with latest military hardware including F-22 Raptor fighters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits particular attention in their moves after the Cheonan case and the Yonphyong Island shelling last year is that they are channeling all efforts into establishing the structure of military confrontation in Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves to knock into shape a triangular military alliance involving the U.S., Japan and south Korea which had been pushed forward from long ago are aimed to militarily dominate the region by mobilizing not only the U.S. imperialist aggression forces but Japan SDF in case of \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula. It is their scenario to form a new military bloc in the region and expand the U.S.-led military blocs to the east and the west and then throughout the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Asian type NATO is more dangerous than NATO, in actuality. The issue of establishing a missile defense system has not been officially stipulated in NATO and it has no operational plan for invading and occupying other countries, in particular. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the above-said triangular military alliance includes the above-said issue and plan. It is more aggressive and interventionist in its nature than NATO. Means and methods of operations are more specified in the alliance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists staged an emergency huddle under the pretext of \"taking a joint counter-action\" against the Yonphyong Island incident at which they agreed with south Korea to take a counter-action by hurling  puppet warmongers as a shock brigade to counter somebody's \"local provocation\" while providing support to them from behind and mobilizing even the Japanese reactionaries. This indicates that they are set to ignite a war against the DPRK by mobilizing multi-national forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts are enough to reveal once again that the U.S. imperialists were behind the above-said two cases. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Bitter Lessons Drawn from Yonphyong Island Shelling \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling that occurred owing to the U.S. and the south Korean group of traitors taught serious lessons to the Korean nation and other world people desirous of peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first lesson is that it is necessary to cross off the illegal \"northern limit line\" and set the extension of MDL in the West Sea of Korea in a fair way at an early date. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The viewpoint and stand on the \"northern limit line\" can serve as a touchstone distinguishing those standing for peace in the West Sea from those opposed to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From a military viewpoint, a curtain of bilateral military conflicts was already raised in the West Sea of Korea. Any armed clash may lead to an all-out war, seriously threatening not only the destiny of the Korean nation but also world peace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"northern limit line\" is a ghostlike line which can convince no one because it was unilaterally drawn in a brigandish way without a bilateral agreement, to say nothing of the requirements of the international law of the sea, the principle of respecting the opponent's 12 mile territorial waters, requirement of AA and the \"law of the sea\" of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even the U.S. imperialists drew the north-south \"imaginary boundary\" in the West Sea of Korea further southward than the \"northern limit line\" on the basis of the principle of equidistance stipulated by the international law of the sea. At that time they were distributing Korean maps to the participants in the UN conference on the law of the sea which was held in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  After the Yonphyong Island shelling, not only the broad international community but also Americans became increasingly vocal calling for re-fixing the \"northern limit line\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Selig Harrison, director for Asia Program of the Center for International Policy of the U.S. who is an expert on Korean affairs, said that it is very easy to solve the West Sea conflict between south and north of Korea. The U.S. has to reset the \"northern limit line\", an extension of MDL in the sea, in the dispute-ridden area a little southward, he added. He went on to say that the U.S. has the right to reset the \"northern limit line\" as it was granted by the UNSC the right to nominate the commander of the UN forces in south Korea in November 1950. The Obama administration must discuss the issue of setting the new boundary in the West Sea of Korea with both sides of Korea, but must not grant the south Korean regime the right to refuse a new boundary if an agreement on it is reached, he pointed out. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The broad international community including political, social and academic circles is becoming increasingly assertive that the U.S. should come out to remove the \"northern limit line\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This represents the world opinion that it is none other than the U.S. which should set the new boundary in the West Sea with responsibility to ensure peace in the waters of the West Sea of Korea. It is the view of the world people that the U.S. imperialists sowed the seed of armed clash and dispute in the waters and the south Korean group of traitors abused it for invasion of the DPRK and confrontation with it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality proves that a top priority task for averting conflicts and disputes and achieving durable peace in the waters is to correctly set the boundary there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another lesson is that the dispute-torn waters should be turned into a peace zone until a new extension of MDL is set there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the common will of the Korean nation to set up peace waters to make the West Sea a sea of national prosperity, not the one of confrontation between fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic October 4 declaration on which the north and the south agreed reflected this will. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This declaration stipulated the principled matters for putting an end to the relations of military hostility, defusing tension and ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula. In particular, it provided the best way for setting up the special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea and fixing a joint fishing zone and peace waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Both sides held the second defence ministerial talks and general-level military talks for the implementation of the October 4 declaration, at which they agreed to take practical measures to prevent conflicts and secure peace in the West Sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK put forward the realistic and principled proposals to implement this agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They included landmark proposals calling on both sides to give up all their assertions from broad mind, handle the West Sea conflict on the basis of the already existing north-south agreements, AA and demand of internationally accepted laws, until a new military demarcation line is set in the West Sea of Korea, and fix the peace waters and joint fishing zone. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean group of traitors scrapped valuable agreements of the Korean nation. As a result, the seed of conflicts and disputes still remains in the waters, becoming a potential flash point of an all-out war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset it paid no heed to the lessons of the past West Sea incidents and the principled ways for solving them put forward by the DPRK. It only worked with blood-shot eyes to maintain the illegal \"northern limit line\" and ignite a war against the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The past history showed that if the south Korean authorities truly hope for peace on the Korean Peninsula, they should give up their stand of preserving the \"northern limit line\" and set a new extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea. And it showed that they should buckle down to putting into practice the proposal for setting the special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea advanced by the DPRK till the new extension of the MDL is set. It also proved that those opposed to this are precisely harassers of peace and provocateurs of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a saying that the past is the \"lamp\" lighting the present and future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is self-evident that if the north and the south do not pull themselves out of the mire of confrontation, sticking to the inglorious past, they can never pave a wide avenue of peace and prosperity, much less achieving peace and stability on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever truly wants the improved north-south relations and values peace on the peninsula, whether they live in the north and the south and abroad, should neither call into question the Cheonan case and the Yonphyong Island shelling any longer nor put them up as any precondition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the Cheonan case has nothing to do with the DPRK. It is the immutable truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling would not have occurred if the south Korean group of traitors had not preempted shelling in the waters of the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For over six decades since the division of Korea, the army of the DPRK has never taken any physical countermeasure against all forms of shelling drills which had been staged in the areas and waters of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the group of traitors tries to link the Cheonan case with the DPRK in a far-fetched way and shift the blame for the Yonphyong Island shelling onto it while turning blind eyes to this stark reality, this will only prove that the group seeks only the escalated confrontation with fellow countrymen and the deteriorated north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK proposed \"On halting military actions which can be recognized as provocation of the other party\" as an agenda of the recent preliminary talks for the opening of the north-south highly-level military talks. This was prompted by the steadfast will to tide over the present developments in a fair and aboveboard way at an early date, the developments which resulted from the distrust and antagonism pent up between the north and the south for a long period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent north-south military dialogue was held with much effort amid the great concern and expectation of the people at home and abroad. The south Korean group of traitors, however, persisted in peddling the two cases there because it sought confrontation and war, not dialogue and peace. As a result, the talks naturally came to a rupture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is too natural that broad strata of south Korea are becoming increasingly concerned and worried that if the present authorities turn their back on the DPRK's proposal for unconditioned dialogue and rush headlong into one-sided confrontation, calling into question the two incidents, this will entail miserable consequences of swamping the whole land of south Korea as the Cheonan warship and turning it into a wormwood field like Yonphyong Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the group of traitors prolonging their remaining days through sycophancy toward the U.S. and escalated confrontation with fellow countrymen is working hard to find a way out in keeping the phase of confrontation under the pretext of the two cases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The further the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean group of traitors \"blame\" the DPRK for the two cases, the more saliently it will reveal their ugly colors as anti-DPRK confrontational fanatics and their effrontery of confusing right and wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will continue doing their utmost to shatter the vicious moves of the worst confrontational elements in the world, improve the north-south relations and ensure peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula."

It also decided to write down Japan's \"dominium over Tok islets\" in all social subject textbooks for elementary schools since 2011.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEarlier, the geographical institute of Japan backed by the Ministry of National Land and Communications announced that Tok islets are marked in the same color as Japan's territory on all the maps issued in Japan, 200,000-300,000 a year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On February 22 there was an event for commemorating \"Day of Takeshima (Tok islets)\" in Shimane Prefecture. Isn't this a good example to show the government's involvement?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok islets are an ancestral territory pertaining to Korea. This has already been proven by the historical data and geographical and legal grounds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such being the hard fact, Japan insists on its \"claim to the islets\" of no validity, attempting to make them an object of dispute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is astonished at the infamy of Japan which seeks to grab Tok islets through its citizens' transfer of domicile though it is arguing with surrounding countries over territorial issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the last century Japan occupied Korea for over 40 years and imposed untold misfortune, sufferings and disasters upon the Koreans in this period. It can never be allowed to dream of staging a comeback to Korea, coveting its inviolable territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan must stop at once its reckless attempt to grab the islets."

La verdad de lo ocurrido en la isla Yonphyong\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La isla Yonphyong, situada en las aguas del Mar Oeste de Corea, tiene una superficie de 6.8 kilometros cuadrados y un perimetro de 18 kilometros, aproximadamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde la antiguedad, la envidiaban mucho los coreanos y hasta los extranjeros porque era una zona pesquera abundante tanto en las especies de peces como en las cantidades de captura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, se ha convertido finalmente en la base avanzada de agresion al Norte cuando los belicistas surcoreanos emplazaron ahi muchos infantes de marines y canones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras desplegar muchos medios de ataque en 5 islas del Mar Oeste de Corea, incluso la Yonphyong, la banda de traidores surcoreanos acecho la oportunidad de provocar planeando el fuego de artilleria y aviacion para defender la \"linea de limite al Norte\", pero no pudo implementar este plan debido a la actitud intransigente del EPC y la opinion publica interna y externa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 22 de noviembre del ano pasado cuando en toda la extension surcoreana se libraba freneticamente el ejercicio anti-RPDC \"Hoguk\", la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor del ejercito titere surcoreano trazo el siniestro plan de disparar los obuses los dias 23 y 24 desde la zona maritima de la isla Yonphyong hacia las aguas jurisdiccionales de la parte Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para frenar los conflictos armados en esa zona delicada y preservar la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana, el EPC envio a las 8 del 23 de noviembre un aviso telefonico a la capa militar surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El aviso demando la cancelacion inmediata del imprudente plan de canoneo hacia las aguas jurisdiccionales de la RPDC y advirtio severamente que si la parte surcoreana no escucha esa demanda, enfrentara un rotundo contraataque fisico del EPC y se responsabilizara de todas las consecuencias que emanen de eso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, la banda de traidores surcoreanos disparo obuses hacia las aguas jurisdiccionales de nuestra parte movilizando la artilleria emplazada en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  De esta manera, la isla Yonphyong, foco de provocacion militar, no pudo evitar el castigo merecido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El despiadado contraataque fisico sobre la isla Yonphyong, que se convirtio en la base militar dejando de ser la cuna de vida de civiles pacificos, confirmo una vez mas a todo el mundo que no es vana la declaracion del EPC, poderoso ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu, de no perdonar a nadie si se atreve a tocar una pulgada del mar, el cielo y la tierra bajo la soberania de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En este mundo no hay nadie que permita al bandido actuar libremente en su casa y ningun ejercito toleraria a los belicistas que abren primero el fuego contra las sagradas aguas jurisdiccionales de su patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debido a los traidores surcoreanos enloquecidos por la confrontacion fratricida, el mar pacifico se convirtio en un santiamen en el escenario de conflicto armado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Afortunadamente, mas de mil 300 moradores de la isla no sufrieron muchos danos porque habian ido al lado opuesto de la posicion de fuego para capturar mariscos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los belicistas titeres no les informaron siquiera el aviso de advertencia del EPC con la vil intencion de frenar el contraataque de este utilizandolos como \"escudo humano\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las \"victimas civiles\" son uno o dos trabajadores civiles de registro militar que estaban en el cuartel del cuerpo de marines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si ellos no hubieran entrado en ese lugar, no habrian sufrido tal desgracia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn lugar de aprender la leccion del fuerte contraataque fisico de nuestro ejercito, la banda de traidores surcoreanos, que paso tremenda pena a la vista del mundo, opto por ampliar la provocacion hablando de \"venganza\" y \"castigo merecido\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ministro titere de Defensa Nacional y otros cabecillas militares fueron sustituidos por los belicistas mas connotados que reforzaron en la isla Yonphyong y su contorno enormes tropas terrestres, navales y aereas y decretaron el \"orden de alerta de emergencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA base de ello, el 20 de diciembre, dispararon mas de una hora en las inmediaciones de la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor el temor al segundo y tercer contraataques de autodefensa del EPC, los titeres surcoreanos modificaron la zona de fuego y el punto de impacto de proyectiles, ya planificados, y se limitaron a disparar los obuses restantes de la provocacion militar de hace un mes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl EPC no le hacia falta responder a las provocaciones militares con fines de propaganda de esos cobardones que pretendieron salvar el decoro de su desmoralizado ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la banda de traidores surcoreanos hubiera lanzado un solo proyectil hacia las aguas jurisdiccionales de la RPDC, habrian sido envueltas en llamas no solo las islas usadas en la provocacion sino hasta Seul. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Canonazos en la isla Yonphyong son continuacion de la larga y sistematica provocacion \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong es la continuacion de la provocacion militar que viene ampliandose y recrudeciendose de manera sistematica de siglo en siglo desde 1953 cuando se publico el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea hasta la fecha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ante la inminente y aplastante derrota en la trienal guerra de agresion (1950-1953) para atropellar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea recien fundada, los titeres surcoreanos se opusieron obstinadamente a la firma del acuerdo mencionado  e hicieron todo lo posible por cancelarlo e invalidarlo preconizando el \"avance independiente hacia el Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tal postura se ha revelado coherentemente en los alrededores de las 5 islas del Mar Oeste de Corea cercanas geograficamente a las costas de la RPDC, en las cuales no se pudo fijar la linea de demarcacion militar maritima durante la firma del Acuerdo de Armisticio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los titeres surcoreanos perpetraron sucesivamente los actos criminales, tales como el secuestro y asesinato de pescadores civiles y el ataque armado contra el territorio de la RPDC, tomando como base de salida la polemica zona maritima y actuaron freneticamente para poner en practica su aventurero plan de \"avance independiente hacia el Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las provocaciones militares de aquel entonces eran tan graves que la Comision de Armisticio Militar decidio fijar esos casos reportados en el Mar Oeste de Corea y otras partes como primer punto de la agenda de su reunion celebrada despues de firmado el Acuerdo de Armisticio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debido a los titeres surcoreanos, las aguas del Mar Oeste de Corea se convirtieron en la base avanzada para desatar la guerra de agresion al Norte y en la zona litigiosa que corre en todo el momento el peligro de enfrentamiento y choque entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La escalada de provocaciones militares durante varias decadas desde la de 1950 hasta la de 1980 genero en la decada de los 90 del siglo pasado unos choques armados irreparables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Un buen ejemplo es el primer conflicto armado en el Mar Oeste de Corea ocurrido en junio de 1999.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando entro en la etapa final la guerra de agresion de EE.UU. y sus satelites contra Yugoslavia, los titeres surcoreanos fijaron a la RPDC como proximo blanco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, seleccionaron las aguas del Mar Oeste de Corea como detonante de la segunda guerra coreana y procedieron a la ejecucion del ya trazado \"proyecto de la operacion provocativa al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmplazaron en las aguas perifericas de la isla Yonphyong la infanteria de marina y mas de 40 buques de combate inclusive 2 destructores de gran tamano, 20 lanchas rapidas, un buque de desembarco de tanques, un barco de patrulla, un buque de abastecimiento, la lancha salvavidas, y abrieron fuego sin previo aviso contra los buques del EPC que cumplian su rutinaria mision de guardia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando fracaso su intento de desatar la guerra total mediante el primer conflicto armado en el Mar Oeste de Corea, los belicistas militares surcoreanos provocaron el segundo conflicto justamente en 2002 cuando en la Peninsula Coreana se hizo mas calido que nunca el clima a favor de reconciliacion y unidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Despues, ampliaron cada ano en forma planificada la incursion en la linea de demarcacion naval de la RPDC y en 2009 desataron el tercer conflicto sin ocultar siquiera su intento de emplear las aguas perifericas de la isla Yonphyong como base avanzada en funcion de provocar la guerra contra el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Despues de la llegada al poder de la banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak, se incrementaron subitamente los casos de incursion en las aguas jurisdiccionales de la RPDC en el Mar Oeste de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo en el ano pasado, se reportaron mas de 600 casos cometidos bajo el pretexto de \"interceptar barcos pesqueros\" y hacer frente al desplazamiento rutinario de los buques de guerra del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como muestran los hechos, los canonazos en la isla Yonphyong no son casuales sino un producto de la campana de confrontacion fratricida de los sucesivos belicistas surcoreanos que prosigue de decada en siglo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Intento criminal de la banda de traidores detras de la provocacion de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se ha dicho antes, el fuego artillero de la isla Yonphyong es una grave provocacion militar cometida como continuacion del incidente de la corbeta \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este caso, fabricado el 26 de marzo del ano pasado sacrificando las vidas de soldados inocentes para la campana de enfrentamiento anti-RPDC, se desenvolvio cada vez mas inconveniente a la camarilla de traidores surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es que el \"resultado de investigacion\" publicado en 2 veces para comprobar la \"teoria de participacion del Norte en el caso\" amplifico la burla y criticas de los nacionales y extranjeros por ser contradictorio y sospechoso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La primera parte del acta de revelacion del CDN de la RPDC ha sido el bisturi que puso al desnudo ante la vista de todo el mundo a los conspiradores que tejieron el incidente de la corbeta \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por el contrario, ellos no tuvieron nada que replicar y anduvieron impacientes por buscar la salida del aprieto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La \"idea magnifica\" de EE.UU. y sus titeres surcoreanos fue llevar al borde de guerra las relaciones Norte-Sur al suscitar la reaccion del EPC disparando contra la zona maritima de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, a pesar de las advertencias repetidas de la RPDC, dispararon balas y obuses hacia la zona maritima de esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sobre todo, esta provocacion persiguio el objetivo de mantener a toda costa la ilegal \"linea de limite al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En julio de 1953, EE.UU., cansado de la guerra coreana tras sufrir una gran derrota, establecio una linea de bloqueo, conocida ahora como \"linea de limite al Norte\" y llamada tambien como \"linea de Clark\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl entonces comandante de las \"fuerzas de la ONU\", Clark, la delineo para disuadir el imprudente intento del traidor Syngman Rhee sobre el \"avance independiente hacia el Norte\" y la posible repeticion de guerra y para bloquear el camino de los pescadores surcoreanos a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En 1975, el ex secretario de Estado de EE.UU., Henry Kissinger, senalo en un mensaje diplomatico que \"NLL (linea de limite al Norte) establecida unilateralmente (por EE.UU.) no es aceptada por el Norte de Corea. El establecimiento unilateral de la linea de demarcacion en alta mar es evidente violacion del derecho internacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Anteriormente, en diciembre de 1973, el entonces embajador estadounidense en el Sur de Corea  expreso la seria preocupacion diciendo que \"si se desata un incidente en NLL, el Sur de Corea y EE.UU. seran vistos mal por la mayoria de paises\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi que hasta EE.UU. y sus satelites reconocen publicamente la ilegalidad de esa linea de demarcacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, aunque paso mucho tiempo, EE.UU. no pudo publicarla al mundo ni mucho menos avisarla a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el circulo politico, el cientifico y el social suenan las opiniones de que la polemica linea es una \"papa caliente\" porque \"carece de logica\" y \"entrana serios problemas practicos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En particular, ella contraviene totalmente al articulo del Acuerdo de Armisticio, segun el cual el comandante de las \"fuerzas de la ONU\" controla las 5 islas Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong y U y la RPDC, todas las demas islas y zonas maritimas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Y viola flagrantemente las normas sobre linea de demarcacion maritima estipuladas por la ley maritima internacional como el respeto a la esfera jurisdiccional de 12 millas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si esta linea hubiera sido establecida respetando las normas legales y antecedentes reconocidas, no habria la necesidad de esforzarse sobremanera por \"mantenerla\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, los titeres surcoreanos escogieron la isla Yonphyong si bien existen incontables islas en el Sur de Corea para defender esa linea que corre el cada dia mas creciente peligro de desaparicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tambien, la provocacion de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong persigue el objetivo de invalidar la historica Declaracion Conjunta N-S del 15 de Junio, valiosa conquista comun de la nacion coreana, y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, programa de implementacion de la primera, y convertir para siempre esa zona maritima en la de confrontacion y choque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar desean unanimemente convertir el Mar Oeste de Corea en la zona pacifica y asegurar el bienestar y la prosperidad comunes de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Numerosos choques armados reportados anteriormente causaron bajas lamentables y sumas astronomicas de perdidas economicas sufridas por pescadores de ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La aprobacion de las dos historicas declaraciones intercoreanas, el proyecto de instalacion de la zona especial de cooperacion pacifica del Mar Oeste y el convenio de la garantia militar del establecimiento de la zona de pesca conjunta y la pacifica son productos de la unanime aspiracion de todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, resulto frustrada la esperanza de los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El traidor Lee Myung Bak con el vicio de vetar a la RPDC fijo la \"desnuclearizacion, apertura y 3000 dolares\" como politica nacional tan pronto como llegara al poder y comenzo a romper los convenios N-S en plena implementacion diciendo que mediria las relaciones intercoreanas no con la \"regla de ideales\" sino con la de \"pragmatismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de traidores anulo totalmente el proyecto encaminado a prevenir la confrontacion y choque militares entre el Norte y el Sur y a asegurar el bienestar y co-prosperidad de la nacion, bajo el pretexto de la \"aprobacion popular\" y la \"carga financiera\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Clasifico los convenios N-S en los de \"cumplimiento prioritario\", los de \"implementacion posterior\" y los \"que no hacen falta cumplir\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, la ejecucion de la historica Declaracion del 4 de Octubre quedo suspendida totalmente y las relaciones N-S volvieron al estado de confrontacion de la epoca de guerra fria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ademas, el Mar Oeste se convirtio otra vez en el espacio de confrontacion y choque militares y en la base avanzada para comenzar la guerra contra el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No por casualidad, la poblacion surcoreana deploro  la batalla de canonazos de la isla Yonphyong expandida hasta la tierra firme, opinando que esta desgracia no habria sucedido si hubiera sido implementada la historica Declaracion del 4 de Octubre.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, el caso de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong es para introducir a su amo norteamericano en la realizacion de su ambicion de agresion al Norte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl traidor Lee Myung Bak fijo por su primera meta la estancia perpetua de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea y cometio sin vacilacion los actos vendepatrias sin precedentes para el \"fortalecimiento de la alianza\" con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no se hizo como deseaba el problema de prolongacion del traslado del mando operacional para el tiempo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs porque ya estaba conocido a todo el mundo que segun el acuerdo de la \"Cumbre\" Sur de Corea-EE.UU. en septiembre de 2006, las conversaciones de los ministros de Defensa, sostenidas en febrero de 2007, decidieron trasladar hasta el 17 de abril de 2012 al ejercito titere el mando operacional para el tiempo de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara la banda traidora necesitaba urgentemente la creacion de \"inquietud de la seguridad\" para preparar el pretexto de la presencia perpetua de las tropas norteamericanas en el suelo surcoreano. Por eso, al cabo de conspiraciones, invento el caso del hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" no en alta mar sino en las aguas jurisdiccionales, ni en el tiempo de guerra sino en el tiempo de paz, ni en plena luz del dia sino a media noche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomandolo por pretexto, los titeres desarrollaron sucesivamente los ejercicios militares maritimos de gran envergadura e introdujeron hasta la flotilla de portaaviones nucleares norteamericanos en la estrecha zona maritima del Mar Oeste de Corea. Y segun su proyecto ya planificado, realizaron las renegociaciones para prologar el periodo de traslado de mando operacional para el tiempo de guerra y por fin, lo prolongo 3 anos y 7 meses mas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando la colera de la poblacion por ese traslado de caracter proyanqui y vendepatria azotaba toda la extension surcoreana, hacia falta para los traidores un incidente sensacional que pudiera mantener la \"inquietud de seguridad\", o sea, el segunda incidente de \"Cheonan\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Partiendo de este designio detallado, inventaron el caso de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara poner en practica esta intencion malsana, la banda traidora de Lee cometio tales aventureras provocaciones militares en dos ocasiones a finales de 2010 y sigue utilizandolas tambien en el ano nuevo a la confrontacion con la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. ?Quien esta detras de la provocacion de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando estallaron sucesivamente los canonazos en la isla Yonphyong pese a las fuertes protestas del interior y el exterior del pais, la atencion del mundo se enfoco en los movimientos de las tropas norteamericanas que permanecen en el Sur de Corea bajo la insignia de la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs que EE.UU., que tiene el \"mando operacional para el tiempo de guerra\" del ejercito surcoreano y es dueno real de la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\" encargada de ejecutar y supervisar el cumplimiento del Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea, amparo y defendio activamente las provocaciones militares de los titeres surcoreanos, lejos de prevenirlas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando estos llevaban la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana al estado a punto de explosion anunciando el plan de segundo fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong, los imperialistas norteamericanos los apoyaron activamente por conducto de la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\" declarando que despacharian a esa isla a mas de veinte hombres de las \"fuerzas de la ONU\" para brindar la asistencia en comunicaciones, medicina, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto partio de la siniestra intencion de convertir el choque entre ambas partes coreanas en el conflicto entre el EPC y la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas norteamericanos enganaron la opinion publica calificando la provocacion militar de la banda surcoreana como \"legitimo ejercicio de canonazos\". Y considerando como hecho consumado el choque armado entre ambas partes coreanas, se preparo en todo lo posible para movilizar a las tropas agresoras ocupantes del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no se reporto ningun choque militar porque el EPC ignoro la sucia provocacion militar de los belicistas titeres a manera de recibir golpes de cara a cara y esgrimir punos a las espaldas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, como habian planeado, los imperialistas norteamericanos enviaron urgentemente al estrecho del Mar Oeste de Corea la flotilla del portaaviones nuclear \"George Washington\" compuesta de crucero, destructor, submarino nuclear, buque de desembarco y decenas de aviones a bordo de portaaviones y los otros \"F-15\" y \"F-16\" para desplegar los ejercicios maritimos conjuntos de gran envergadura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, enviaron a mas de diez mil efectivos, la flotilla de portaaviones nuclear y mas de 150 cazas al mar frente a Okinawa de Japon para librar el ejercicio militar conjunto mas grande en la historia en cooperacion con 34 mil efectivos, 40 buques de guerra y 250 aviones de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta maniobra participaron hasta los titeres surcoreanos en calidad de \"observadores\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, llamaron a Washington a los lacayos de alto rango del Sur de Corea y Japon y discutieron sobre la \"reaccion conjunta\" y la \"estrecha cooperacion\" contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales acciones de los imperialistas norteamericanos en la invencion del caso de \"Cheonan\" y el de canonazos en la isla de Yonphyong parten de su intento de establecer y completar la estructura de confrontacion militar en el Nordeste Asiatico pretextando la tensa situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y de realizar su ambicion de dominar todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se ha revelado, la politica de Asia-Pacifico de EE.UU. constituye la esencia de la estrategia del siglo 21 sobre la conquista del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara la realizacion de esta estrategia, los imperialistas norteamericanos conceden mucha importancia a la region del Nordeste Asiatico donde estan concentradas las potencias, sobre todo, a la Peninsula Coreana muy importante tanto en lo geoestrategico como en la posicion estrategica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos piensan que si no controlan toda la Peninsula Coreana, no pueden dominar el continente asiatico, ni formar el cerco militar sobre el continente eurasiatico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs decir, preven que si doblegan a las potencias del Nordeste Asiatico tras tomar la Peninsula Coreana, podrian conquistar facilmente todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la realidad no marcho como esperaban ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien aplicaron todos los metodos para derrumbar el socialismo al estilo coreano como el aislamiento y estrangulacion en la rama economica, la guerra psicologica, la presion militar, etc. sufrieron fracasos repetidos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl contrario, debido a las nuevas circunstancias en el interior y el exterior del pais y la crisis, se debilitaron cada dia mas la influencia y el dominio de EE.UU. en el Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl imperio le hacia mucha falta ser influyente mediante el uso de fuerzas armadas con una justificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ahi que instigo a la banda surcoreana a orquestar el hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" y despues, le permitio oficialmente la \"respuesta de autodefensa\" y la \"enmienda de la regla de beligerancia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPosteriormente, instigo a ejecutar la provocacion de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong prometiendo la entrega de \"informaciones del Norte\" en el tiempo de enfrentamiento armado entre el Norte y el Sur y enviando enseguida las fuerzas armadas sofisticadas como aviones \"F-22 Raptor\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que centra mas atencion en los movimientos de los imperialistas norteamericanos tras los dos incidentes, es que hacen todo lo posible para establecer la estructura de confrontacion militar en la region asiatica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas maniobras del imperio de formar la \"alianza militar tripartita\" con Japon y el Sur de Corea, que comenzaron ya mucho antes, tienen la meta de dominar militarmente a Asia movilizando a las tropas agresoras norteamericanos y a las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" de Japon en el \"tiempo de emergencia\" de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio intenta crear en la region un nuevo bloque militar, con que pretende ampliar los otros bajo su mando como los de alcance global que abarquen el Este y el Occidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa OTAN de version asiatica es mucho mas peligrosa que la OTAN real porque esta ultima no ha oficializado todavia el problema de establecimiento del sistema antimisiles ni trazado el plan de operacion para agredir y ocupar a otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero la susodicha alianza militar tripartita contiene lo todo en detalles y tiene el caracter mas agresivo e intervencionista que la OTAN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio realizo la conspiracion urgente con el pretexto de \"reaccion conjunta\" frente al caso de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong, en la cual acordo poner en la delantera a los belicistas surcoreanos, ayudar a estos y movilizar hasta a los reaccionarios japoneses para hacer frente a la \"provocacion local\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra que el imperio intenta hacer la guerra de agresion contra la RPDC incorporando a las fuerzas armadas multinacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos arriba mencionados bastan para revelar a todo el mundo que EE.UU. dirigio detras de la cortina los casos de \"Cheonan\" y de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Canonazos en la isla Yonphyong dan serias lecciones \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El incidente de fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong ensena serias lecciones a la nacion coreana y los demas pueblos del mundo aspirantes a la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ante todo, urgen cancelar la ilegal \"linea del limite al Norte\" y establecer imparcialmente la otra de demarcacion militar en el Mar Oeste de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy en dia, el punto de vista y la posicion sobre la \"linea del limite al Norte\" devienen la pauta que determina la aspiracion o no a la paz en el Mar Oeste de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desde el punto de vista militar, en dicho mar comenzo ya el conflicto militar entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi esto entra en etapa crucial, se expandira a la guerra total incluyendo los combates terrestres y aereos y amenazara severamente la existencia de la nacion coreana y la paz del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La \"linea del limite al Norte\" es la fantasmal, bandidesca e inaceptable que desprecia la ley maritima internacional, el principio de respetar a la esfera maritima jurisdiccional de 12 millas de la contraparte, el Acuerdo del Armisticio de Corea, la \"ley maritima\" del Sur de Corea, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hasta los cinicos imperialistas norteamericanos habian fijado la \"simulada linea divisoria\" entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea en el Mar Oeste en el punto mucho mas al sur de la \"linea de limite al Norte\" respetando el principio de equidistancia determinado por la ley maritima internacional, cuando distribuyeron el mapa de Corea a los participantes en la reunion de la ONU sobre la legislacion maritima efectuada en su pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Despues de ocurrido el incidente de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong, en amplio circulo internacional y el territorio norteamericano resuenan continuamente las voces en demanda del reestablecimiento de la \"linea de limite al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El director para el Plan de Asia del Centro de la Politica Internacional de EE.UU., Selig Harrison, quien es experto en los asuntos de Corea, dijo que    \"es muy simple la solucion del litigio intercoreano en el Mar Oeste\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Prosiguio que \"EE.UU. debe reestablecer la linea de demarcacion maritima llamada como ´linea de limite al Norte´ en la zona de conflicto desplazandola un poco hacia el sur\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Especifico que como el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU otorgo en noviembre de 1950 a EE.UU. la autoridad de nombrar al comandante de las fuerzas de la ONU en el Sur de Corea, EE.UU. tiene el poder de reestablecer la 'linea de limite al Norte'\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Anadio que la \"administracion Obama debe consultar ese tema con ambas partes coreanas y no ha de conceder al gobierno surcoreano el derecho a vetar la nueva linea de demarcacion cuando esta fuera acordada\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Distintos sectores del mundo incluyendo los circulos politico, social y cientifico demandan tambien fuertemente a EE.UU. que cancele la \"linea de limite al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto representa la opinion publica mundial de que EE.UU. debe ser responsable del establecimiento de nueva linea de limite para asegurar la paz en esa zona maritima porque el mismo ha creado la semilla del choque y conflicto militares y la banda de  traidores surcoreanos la usa en su campana de enfrentamiento contra el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra que la tarea mas importante y urgente para prevenir el choque y el litigio y lograr la paz duradera en el Mar Oeste de Corea es establecer correctamente la linea de demarcacion maritima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La segunda leccion, que ensena el incidente de la isla Yonphyong, es que se debe convertir las aguas de conflicto en las pacificas hasta que se establezca la nueva linea de demarcacion militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hacer del Mar Oeste de Corea el mar de prosperidad nacional y libre de confrontacion fratricida estableciendo la zona pacifica es la voluntad comun de todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La historica Declaracion del 4 de Octubre es el acuerdo de importancia historica nacional que reflejo dicha voluntad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En esta declaracion estan aclarados los problemas de principios para poner fin a las relaciones militares hostiles, aliviar la tension y preservar la paz en la Peninsula Coreana, especialmente, el mejor proyecto para establecer la \"Zona especial de cooperacion pacifica del Mar Oeste\", la zona de pesca conjunta y las aguas pacificas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ambas partes coreanas realizaron la segunda ronda de conversaciones de los ministros de fuerzas armadas y las otras a nivel de general entre el Norte y el Sur con vistas a ejecutar la declaracion arriba mencionada, en que coincidieron en tomar en ellas las medidas practicas con el fin de prevenir el choque y preservar la paz en el Mar Oeste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejercito y el pueblo coreanos presentaron las realistas propuestas de principios para poner en practica tal acuerdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Entre ellas se incluyen los proyectos trascendentales de que ambas partes abandonen simultanea y magnanimamente sus criterios existentes, traten el problema de choque a base del acuerdo ya logrado entre el Norte y el Sur, el Acuerdo de Armisticio y la demanda legal reconocida internacionalmente hasta cuando se define definitivamente la linea de demarcacion militar en el Mar Oeste y establezcan las aguas pacificas y la zona de pesca conjunta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, la banda surcoreana invalido los preciosos acuerdos de la nacion coreana, debido a lo cual la chispa de choque y conflicto en esta zona maritima no se ha apagado todavia, al contrario, amenaza con desatar una guerra total.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A ella no le importan ni un comino las lecciones de los incidentes ocurridos en el Mar Oeste y el proyecto de principios de la RPDC para resolverlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta interesada unicamente en mantener la ilegal \"linea de limite al Norte\" y provocar la guerra de agresion al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia pasada muestra que si desean de veras la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, deben abandonar la posicion de mantener la \"linea de limite al Norte\", fijar la nueva linea de demarcacion militar maritima en el Mar Oeste de Corea y esforzarse por llevar a efecto nuestro proyecto de establecer la zona especial de cooperacion pacifica del Mar Oeste hasta que sea realizada nueva linea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY comprueba fehacientemente que los que se oponen a ello son perturbadores de la paz y provocadores de la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay un refran que dice: El pasado es el “faro” que ilumina el presente y el futuro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi no se liberan del pantano de la confrontacion fratricida inclinandose al pasado vergonzoso, el Norte y el Sur de Corea no pueden entrar en amplio camino para la paz y la prosperidad ni lograr la paz ni la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar que desean sinceramente la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas y aprecian la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, no deben cuestionar por mas tiempo el incidente del hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" y el caso de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong ni tomarlos por una premisa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvidentemente dicho, el caso de \"Cheonan\" no tiene nada que ver con la RPDC, lo cual es siempre invariable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong tampoco se habria ocurrido, si la banda traidora no hubiera disparado primero hacia nuestras aguas maritimas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA mas de 60 anos de la division del pais, nuestro ejercito no habia asestado en ningun caso un contraataque fisico a los ejercicios de canonazo de distintos tipos realizados en la extension y las aguas jurisdiccionales del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDar espaldas a esta realidad y vincular el caso de \"Cheonan\" con la RPDC e imponerle la responsabilidad de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong, esto sera un testigo vivido de que ellos persiguen solo la confrontacion fratricida y el empeoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el dialogo previo para las conversaciones militares de alto nivel Norte-Sur, nuestro ejercito presento el tema intitulado \"Para prohibir las acciones militares que puedan ser provocaciones para ambas partes\" partiendo de la invariable voluntad de eliminar cuanto antes de modo imparcial la crisis actual creada por la desconfianza y la hostilidad arraigadas entre ambas partes coreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora insistio tan tenazmente en los dos incidentes en el lugar de dialogo militar Norte-Sur, preparado dificilmente en medio de gran atencion y esperanza del interior y el exterior del pais, porque persiguio la confrontacion y la guerra, en lugar del dialogo y la paz. Por lo tanto, fue inevitable la ruptura del dialogo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora distintos circulos surcoreanos expresan grandes preocupaciones de que si las autoridades actuales dan espaldas a la propuesta de dialogo incondicional de la parte Norte y mantiene la posicion unilateral de confrontacion pretextando el caso de \"Cheonan\" y el de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong, toda la extension surcoreana se hundira como el barco \"Cheonan\" y se convertira en las ruinas como la isla Yonphyong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los traidores surcoreanos, que mantienen su vida restante con el servilismo proyanqui y la confrontacion fratricida, se desesperan por buscar su salida en el mantenimiento de la coyuntura de enfrentamiento so pretexto de los dos incidentes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas los imperialistas norteamericanos y la banda de traidores surcoreanos hablan tanto de la \"responsabilidad\" de alguien por dichos casos, tanto mas se revelaran a todo el mundo la naturaleza y el caracter cinicos de los maniacos de confrontacion anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea haran ingentes esfuerzos por frustrar las maniobras brutales de los maniacos de confrontacion fratricida sin pares, mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas y preservar la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana."
