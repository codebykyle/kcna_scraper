Comite Central del Partido, pronunciado por el Mariscal Kim Jong Un, aceptandolo como inmortal bandera que ilumina el futuro radiante del PTC y del desarrollo de la revolucion y como gran programa que abrio el camino eterno de la revolucion del Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl VII Congreso del PTC expreso la firme decision de enaltecer al Presidente Kim Il Sung y al Dirigente Kim Jong Il como eternos lideres del PTC y adelantar la victoria de la causa de transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsungismo-Kimjongilismo, la reunificacion de la patria y la causa de verificacion de la independencia en el mundo entero bajo la orientacion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe ampliar y fortalecer por todos los medios el poderio politico, militar y economico acelerando activamente la transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsungismo-Kimjongilismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todos los dominios deben materializar cabalmente los legados de los grandes Lideres antecesores y desarrollar el PTC, el Estado y el ejercito como los eternos de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que consolidar la posicion de la potencia politica y militar y colocar la bandera de victoria en la cima de la potencia cientifico-tecnica, la economica y la civilizada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando la linea general de la construccion socialista y el principio de dar primacia al autofortalecimiento como lineas estrategicas permanentes, lograremos la gran victoria en la construccion de la potencia socialista y llevaremos a feliz termino la historica causa de transformar toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsungismo-Kimjongilismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLograremos en corto plazo nuevos saltos en el desarrollo de ciencias y tecnicas, abriremos la era que prosperara con las ciencias y registraremos un cambio revolucionario en la construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que elaborar de manera cientifica y realista y ejecutar sin falta la estrategia por etapas para el desarrollo de la economia nacional y cumplir por inmediato la estrategia quinquenal para el desarrollo de la economia nacional desde 2016 hasta 2020.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta acelerar la construccion de la potencia socialista civilizada para formar a todos los habitantes como poderosos sujetos de la construccion socialista con abundantes conocimientos y elevadas facultades culturales y ofrecerles las condiciones y el ambiente favorables a disfrutar a sus anchas de una vida abundante y culta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe aceptar la transformacion de todo el ejercito segun el Kimilsungismo-Kimjongilismo como deber general de la construccion del ejercito y realizarlo sin falta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsistimos en la reunificacion segun el sistema federal y hacemos todos los esfuerzos por la reunificacion pacifica, pero, si las autoridades optan al fin y al cabo el camino de guerra persistiendo en la injusta \"unificacion institucional\", eliminaremos sin piedad a las fuerzas anti-reunificacion mediante la gran guerra justa de reunificacion y lograremos la causa historica de la reunificacion, deseo de toda la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnarbolaremos en alto la bandera de la independencia nacional y la gran unidad nacional y nos esforzaremos activamente por realizar la reunificacion mediante la forma del sistema federal, de modo que construiremos lo mas pronto posible una potencia reunificada independiente y prospera, a que desean todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Al tomar el ideal de la independencia, la paz y la amistad como inconmovible guia de las actividades exteriores, ampliaremos y desarrollaremos las relaciones de buena vecindad, amistad y cooperacion con varios paises del mundo que respetan la soberania de nuestro pais y nos tratan amistosamente, asi como nos esforzaremos mucho por defender la paz y seguridad de la region y realizar la independencia del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El PTC y el gobierno de la RPDC marcharan rectamente siguiendo la ruta invariable de la independencia, el Songun y el socialismo, independientemente del cambio de la situacion y de las relaciones entre los paises contornos y cumpliran el papel vanguardista en la lucha por realizar la independencia del mundo como defensores de la independencia y la justicia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Apoyandose en el poderoso disuasivo nuclear acabaran de raiz con el peligro de guerra nuclear impuesto por los Estados Unidos y lucharan con dinamismo por defender la paz de la region y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Intensificaran aun mas en lo cualitativo y cuantitativo las fuerzas armadas nucleares de autodefensa tomando permanentemente la linea estrategica de desarrollar paralelamente la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares, mientras que sigan la amenaza nuclear y la arbitrariedad de los imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya aclaro, la RPDC, como responsable pais poseedor de armas nucleares, no sera primera en usar las armas nucleares contra las agresivas fuerzas hostiles si estas no violan con sus artefactos nucleares a nuestra soberania, y se esforzara por realizar la desnuclearizacion del mundo ejecutando con sinceridad su deber de no proliferacion nuclear asumido ante la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El PTC y el gobierno de la RPDC se uniran y cooperaran con todos los paises y naciones aspirantes a la independencia y amantes de la justicia sin consideracion a las diferencias de ideas y regimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, mejoraran y normalizaran las relaciones con los paises que respetan la soberania de nuestro pais y nos tratan amistosamente aunque en el pasado tuvieron las relaciones hostiles con nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lograran un nuevo viraje en la lucha historica por trasformar toda la sociedad segun el Kimilsungismo-Kimjongilismo, al fortalecer y desarrollar incesantemente el PTC como partido de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il y elevar por todos los medios el papel directivo del Partido.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La resolucion subraya que el PTC conducira con toda seguridad por el camino de victoria la lucha de revolucion y la construccion del pueblo coreano sosteniendo al Mariscal Kim Jong Un en supremo cargo de la revolucion del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El VII Congreso del PTC expreso la confianza de que todo el Partido y todo el pueblo, unidos firmemente en torno al Mariscal, desarrollaran con dinamismo la ofensiva general por fortalecer y desarrollar el Partido, llevar feliz termino la causa socialista y realizar la reunificacion independiente de la patria y la causa de independencia del mundo enarbolando la bandera revolucionaria del Kimilsungismo-Kimjongilismo."
