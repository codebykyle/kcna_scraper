This was a great eruption of its irrepressible hatred and wrath at the enemy which committed the thrice-cursed act of daring attempt to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. It was, at the same time, the beginning of the merciless retaliatory campaign to put the most miserable end to the Park Geun Hye group of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The long-range artillery force of the large combined unit of the KPA on the front sent the following ultimatum to the Park Geun Hye group Saturday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. The thrice-cursed traitor Park and her group should make an official apology to all Koreans in the north, the south and abroad for daring commit high treason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our dignified sun of Songun represents the life and destiny of all Koreans and their rosy future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the worst crime never to be pardoned in the world to dare attempt to slander and do harm to the sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group should apologize to all Koreans. This will be the last and the best way for it to spend its remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. Park Geun Hye, traitor without an equal in the world, and her group should mete out the severest punishment to the worst criminals at once as they mapped out the thrice-cursed \"operation for striking the leadership\" and dreamed of its implementation and finish them off without mercy on behalf of all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If there is a sin which must not be committed as a human being in the world, it is a foolish act to do harm to the sun in the sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither excuse nor evasion of responsibility is allowed for such high treason. It only deserves the severest punishment of Heaven.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Put them to death in the eyes of all fellow countrymen. This would be the last opportunity for the Chongwadae, cesspool of evils, and reactionary ruling machines to escape baptism of retaliatory fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. If matchless traitor Park Geun Hye and her group do not respond to the ultimatum of the KPA, the long-range artillery force of the KPA large combined unit on the front will move over to merciless military action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Public apology and punishment are the ultimatum of the long-range artillery force of the KPA which keeps the Chongwadae and the reactionary ruling machines within the firing range and waits for an order for a preemptive strike to punish the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the force is just a click away from pushing the button for intensive strike, the enemy's positions that produced all evils and tragedies of confrontation between compatriots and national division will turn into ashes in a moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how busy Park and her group may go, talking about the \"strengthening of guard posture across south Korea\" and \"urgent meeting of operational officers\", this would get them nowhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only way out for them is to sincerely accept the ultimatum of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should always remember that the Chongwadae and the reactionary ruling machines are within the intensive striking range of the long-range artillery force of the KPA large combined unit on the front.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Paektusan army says is not hot air."

It also seems the U.S. has become so nervous as to mistake the thunder for the nuclear explosion as it failed to discern the ballistic missile fire and multiple rocket launching system fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has deployed all sorts of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons in south Korea after calculating that its persistent unprecedented and heinous policy of blockading the DPRK would prevent the latter from bolstering its strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its wild dream went up in smoke and very expensive weapons turned into scrap iron in the face of the DPRK's H-bomb test and showing off of its military muscle through ballistic rocket fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deployment of the multiple rocket launching system is like a horrible nightmare for the U.S. as the system is of great strategic significance in remarkably increasing the capabilities of the Korean People's Army in mounting precision attacks on the enemies' targets in the operational theater in the southern part of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ridiculous and hysterical behavior just stems from its horror of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. fears the DPRK so much, the former should have withdrawn all its military hardware from south Korea and stopped joint military drills for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. desperate efforts for finding other recipe for curing its hysteria will only invite criticism and denunciation by the world people and self-ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK can never allow the U.S. to unreasonably find fault with the former out of inveterate repugnance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is staging the nuclear war drills targeting the DPRK while openly revealing its ulterior intention to do harm to the dignity of the supreme leadership and social system of the latter even by throwing away its mask of \"annual and defensive exercises\". This makes the international community believe that the U.S. is, indeed, the arch criminal escalating tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the DPRK takes military countermeasures, the U.S. is slandering the former by raking all stooges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is aimed to shift the blame for the escalating tension on the Korean peninsula on to the DPRK by intentionally and persistently pulling it up and label it as the \"violator of international law\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's recent measures are due ones for self-defense to stand up against the U.S. which is staging a series of military acts aiming at the former's headquarters by mobilizing the largest number of aggression troops and strategic assets in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. cannot label the DPRK's toughest countermeasures for safeguarding the sovereignty and right to existence of the country and the nation as illegal ones nor can it conceal its criminal nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless the U.S. drops its nuclear threat and blackmail and hostile policy toward the DPRK, the latter will take stronger measures for self-defense to cope with them."

Pero, no pueden encontrarse con sobrenombres tan asquerosos y fastidiados como los de Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cada uno de sus sobrenombres ignominiosos estan concentrados todos sus crimenes imperdonables contra el pais y la nacion y reflejadas el odio, la condena y la colera de la nacion dirigidas a esa traidora vendepatria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la nota, la poblacion surcoreana le bautizo como Lee Myung-bak Geun-hye porque todo lo que hace ella se asemeja a los quehaceres de Lee que llevo a la ruptura las relaciones intercoreanas. Tambien le puso el mal apodo de Pal Kkun-hae, que significa una vieja de corazon frio que llevo al fracaso las relaciones intercoreanas siempre encolerizandose de subito.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, ella se llama Pa Kku-ne, que significa una vieja caprichosa cambiando todo con frecuencia si no le agrada, Ppo Kun-hae en el sentido de que los habitantes surcoreanos se sienten cansados ante el poder de ella. Ademas se llama Tak Kku-ne porque ella sigue repitiendo solo la palabra \"confrontacion fratricida\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien le puso el apodo de Kke Kkun-hae calificandola de vieja sucia porque ella, insatisfecha con haber vendido a las fuerzas ajenas su cuerpo y el pais, vende hasta sus connacionales. Tambien, la poblacion surcoreana le llama Toksa (vibora) Geun-hye por su actitud virulenta. Ademas suele llamarle Kae (perra) Geun-hye porque ella prefiere a perro mas que el ser humano, y Ak Geun-hye en el sentido de que le queda solo la rabia nerviosa."

            "content": "ACNC comenta conducta ridicula de psicopatas\r\nPyongyang, 26 de marzo (ACNC) -- Estados Unidos cuestionan sin ton ni son el reciente tiro del nuevo lanzacohetes reactivo autopropulsado de grueso calibre de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea como \"lanzamiento de misiles de corta distancia\" y lo califica de la violacion de la \"resolucion\" de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como se informara el dia 21 la noticia del tiro de estas armas de nuevo tipo de la RPDC, los titeres surcoreanos picotearon que \"el Norte lanzo los misiles de corta distancia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, el delegado especial para la politica sobre la RPDC y el vocero para Asia Oriental y el Pacifico del Departamento de Estado norteamericano y el vocero del Pentagono disparatearon uno tras otro que \"el lanzamiento de misiles en que se aplico la tecnica de lanzamiento de misiles balisticos deviene la innegable violacion a la resolucion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU\" y \"el Norte de Corea debe contenerse en sus actos de agravar la tension y enfocar en tomar las medidas detalladas para observar la promesa y el deber internacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo podemos menos que calificar del trastorno psiquico esa actitud de los enemigos atemorizados ante los sonidos de unos proyectiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, EE.UU. espantado con el gran poderio militar de la RPDC, esta fuera de si.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando la RPDC hizo de publico conocimiento las ojivas nucleares aligeradas, estandarizadas y normalizadas, el presidente del Instituto para Ciencia y Seguridad Internacional de EE.UU. palidecio de asombro diciendo que \"el Norte de Corea ya habria tenido la capacidad de la minimizacion de las ojivas nucleares\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl realizarse el entrenamiento de lanzamiento de cohetes balisticos de las fuerzas estrategicas del Ejercito Popular de Corea, dijo que \"la ojiva separada reentro con exito en el atmosfera resistiendo al calor de friccion y se exploto con exito en la altura ya definida.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY anadio con el extremo terror que \"podria crearse en realidad el caos en que debido a la explotacion nuclear en el aire de la Peninsula Coreana se paralizaran todos los sistemas electronicos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo tales circunstancias, EE.UU. se queda aturdido confundiendo hasta el tiro de lanzacohetes reactivo autopropulsado con el lanzamiento de misiles balisticos, lo cual nos hace recordar el refran: el gato escaldado del agua fria huye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho de que EE.UU. no distingue el lanzamiento de misiles balisticos del tiro de lanzacohetes reactivo autopropulsado, causa una preocupacion de que por su neurastenia el equivoque el sonido del trueno con la explotacion nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. introdujo con el alma sosegada las armas nucleares estrategicas y tacticas de todo tipo en el Sur de Corea calculando que si mantiene la atroz politica de bloqueo sin precedente, la RPDC no cultivara sus fuerzas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la grandiosa detonacion de la bomba de hidrogeno de la RPDC y el manifiesto del poderio de los cohetes balisticos que superan la imaginacion, convirtieron en espuma la ilusion absurda del imperio yanqui y en chatarra las preciosas armas emplazadas en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecialmente, a EE.UU. le dio la gran pesadilla el emplazamiento del magnifico sistema de las armas arriba mencionadas del Ejercito Popular de Corea que tiene gran efectividad y significacion estrategica en el trabajo para fortalecer considerablemente la capacidad de ataque de exactitud contra los objetos enemigos de la zona de operacion de la parte surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales conductas ridiculas de trastorno psicopata de EE.UU. parten precisamente del temor morbido sobre la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. tiene tanto miedo a la RPDC, deberia retirar todos los pertrechos militares introducidos en el Sur de Corea y sus tropas y cesar los ejercicios militares conjuntos del caracter agresivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor mucho que haga esfuerzos desesperados por buscar otra receta dando persistentemente la espalda a este simple metodo de tratamiento del trastorno psicopata y fobia, no podra evitar la burla y el vituperio de todo el mundo, sino le tocara solo el destino de autodestruccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo tenemos nada que ver con el trastorno psiquico de EE.UU., pero no podemos tolerar los actos de el que, preso del veto constitucional, nos cuestiona injustamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la Peninsula Coreana EE.UU. libra el entrenamiento de guerra nuclear para agredir la RPDC abandonando hasta el rotulo \"anual\" y \"defensivo\" y mostrando abiertamente su intencion de atacar la maxima dignidad y regimen de ella, razon por la cual, en la escena internacional va prevaleciendo la opinion en que EE.UU. es autor de la agravacion de tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApresurado por esta situacion, EE.UU. se vale de todos los medios para calumniar la RPDC movilizando a todos sus lacayos en todas las ocasiones en que la RPDC tomaba las contramedidas militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa intencion de EE.UU. es acusar de manera continua e intencional la RPDC para imputarle la responsabilidad de la agravacion de la tension en la Peninsula Coreana y tildarle del \"quebrantador de ley internacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas recientes medidas de accion de la RPDC devienen las merecidas de autodefensa tomadas frente a las maniobras de EE.UU. que libra sucesivamente las locuras militares contra la Direccion de la Revolucion Coreana movilizando las fuerzas armadas agresoras y los bienes estrategicos de gran tamano sin precedente en la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio yanqui no puede tildar con nada de los actos ilegales las medidas de intransigencia redoblada anti-EE.UU. de la RPDC tomadas para defender la soberania y el derecho a la existencia del pais y la nacion ni encubrir su naturaleza criminal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras EE.UU. no abandone la amenaza y chantaje nucleares y la politica hostil contra la RPDC, esta redoblara mas y mas las medidas autodefensivas para enfrentarse con ello."
