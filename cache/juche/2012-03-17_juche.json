It is actually illogical for the Lee group to host an international meeting related to the matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe successive ruling forces made desperate efforts to plunge the Korean nation into a nuclear holocaust in collusion with their master, while offering south Korea to the U.S. as the nuclear war testing ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group put on the shelf the criminal acts it committed by bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the Korean Peninsula and described the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defense as a \"nuclear threat\". It has now gone impudent enough to busy itself hosting the summit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to realize the denuclearization on the Peninsula, the U.S. should drop the policy of hostility toward the DPRK and stop the nuclear threat against it including the nuclear war drills. If the south Korean conservative group escalates the DPRK-targeted nuclear racket while talking about hosting the summit in collusion with the U.S., this will render a solution to the nuclear issue on the peninsula more difficult."

It was a great event to be recorded in the history of national liberation struggles in colonial countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter that he founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (then Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army) on April 25, 1932 to lead the anti-Japanese war to victory."
