They hurled into the war even troops of its satellite countries by abusing the UN flag, and applied all sorts of the most brutal war methods and means including the threat of A-bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK defeated the invaders of 16 countries including the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic victory in the war was the victory of the Juche-oriented military idea and outstanding strategy and tactics of President Kim Il Sung and one of the indomitable mental power of the army and people of the DPRK as they heroically fought, united close around the party and the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists sustained a heavy defeat for the first time in their more than 100-year-long history of wars of aggression in the three-year-long Korean war and signed an instrument of surrender.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, which beat back U.S. imperialism, was widely known as a country of heroes and its army and people earned worldwide fame as a heroic army and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the war the party and government of China sent volunteers organized by its fine sons and daughters under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, safeguarding the home and defending the motherland even under the difficult situation where they just won victory in the people's revolution. They helped the Korean people in their just struggle at the cost of blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The internationalist example set by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war recorded a shining page in the history of the DPRK-China friendship and the Korean party and people will always remember this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK greeted a new era of history   in which they are successfully carrying forward the history and tradition of sure victory which started in Mt. Paektu and reliably steering the human cause of independence, thanks to Kim Jong Un, the reporter noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should hold the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the eternal leaders of our party and people and the sun of Juche for all ages and firmly uphold and eternally glorify the undying feats Kim Il Sung performed by winning a victory in the war and the Songun revolutionary feats of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will continue dynamically advancing for peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and the rest of the world together with the progressive people who aspire after justice and value conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only July 27 of victory will be in store for the DPRK as the undying feats Kim Il Sung performed by winning the victory in the war and the Songun revolutionary exploits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are shedding their rays and there are the invincible Paektusan army and the great unity of the army and people wisely led by Marshal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Similar meetings took place in provinces, cities (districts), counties and industrial complexes to mark the anniversary."

Korean Authorities' Moves to Defer Transfer of OPECON under Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Friday released its information bulletin No. 1039 blasting the south Korean authorities for imploring the U.S. to postpone the transfer of the wartime operation control (OPECON).\n\t\t\t\t\t The information bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t OPECON was granted by traitor Syngman Rhee to the U.S. during the Korean war. South Korea was supposed to take over the right in 2012 but the Lee Myung Bak group requested Washington to defer the transfer till 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of south Korea made the takeover of the right her \"election\" commitment. She clarified her stand that she would take over it in 2015 as scheduled after coming to power. She singled out it as a core task of diplomatic and security policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the puppet regime reneged on its commitment in defiance of public demand. It tacitly asked again its American masters to postpone the transfer of the right, talking about \"north's nukes\" and \"security threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the aim sought by the regime in this move, the bulletin went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group's moves for postponing the transfer of OPECON are dangerous moves to escalate the tension in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and increase the  danger of a nuclear war against the north. They are pursuant to the U.S. sinister scenario to more effectively use south Korea as an outpost for realizing the U.S. strategy to dominate Asia and hurl the puppet army as a shock brigade for its aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group's attempt to defer the transfer of OPECON comes true, the U.S. will get more desperate in its moves to provoke a war against the DPRK and carry out its strategy for world domination, keeping a firmer grip on south Korea militarily and pursuing its hostile policy towards Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its moves more clearly reveal the true colors of the present regime of south Korea as poor colonial servant who regards submission to the U.S. and service to it as a mode of existence and a group of sycophants and traitors hell-bent on dependence on foreign forces and confrontation with fellow countrymen, utterly indifferent to the dignity and interests of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such guys are loudmouthed about an \"advanced country\", \"national status\" and \"dignity\" though they are trying hard to prolong their remaining days dependent on their master, leaving even military sovereignty to the tender mercy of outside forces. It is a political caricature provoking side-splitting laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea can never shake off its disgrace as a politically underdeveloped region and colony and its people cannot escape misfortune, sufferings and war disaster as long as the pro-U.S. and sycophantic and treacherous group is allowed to ride roughshod, concluded the information bulletin."

And this was supported by the judiciary authorities of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, the Japanese government described its soldiers killed by peasant troops as those who fell in the battles with the Qing troops and added their names to the mortuary tablet on Yasukuni Shrine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disclosing the diary, the professor said that it contained many words such as \"Capture and shoot them to death\", \"Cruelly torture\", \"Shoot them all to death,\" \"Set fire to all Koreans' houses,\" \"Burn them to death\" and \"Torture and shoot them to death and burn their dead bodies.\" This bears witness to the cruelty of the then army of Japan, professor added."

            "content": "6a ronda de conversaciones de trabajo entre Norte y Sur de Corea para normalizar ZIK\r\nPyongyang, 26 de julio (ACNC) -- Tuvo lugar el dia 25 en la Zona Industrial de Kaesong (ZIK) la 6a ronda de conversaciones de trabajo entre autoridades del Norte y el Sur de Corea para normalizar las operaciones de la Zona Industrial de Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la ocasion, la parte nortena se refirio a la necesidad de eliminar algunas diferencias existentes y llegar a un acuerdo dado que a traves de las pasadas conversaciones en 5 ocasiones, ambas partes intercambiaron suficientes consultas y criterios mediante el cambio de acuerdos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY presento otra vez el proyecto reenmendado del acuerdo real y racional que refleja tambien el criterio de la parte surena, tales como el  tema de no hacer los trabajos negativos a la normalizacion de la ZIK sin recibir influencia de la situacion en cualquier caso, el de asegurar la seguridad fisica de los visitantes a la ZIK, proteger los bienes invertidos de las empresas y solucionar la comunicacion, paso y entrada de aduana, el de garantizar las actividades empresariales a nivel internacional y convertir la ZIK en una zona economica con competitividad internacional, el de reanudar la oficina consultiva de las cooperaciones economicas Norte-Sur y organizar y gestionar el comite comun, el de impulsar simultanea y generalmente todas las medidas para el reinicio y la normalizacion de la ZIK y otros y consulto por el respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSobre todo, la parte nortena propuso sinceramente reflejar en el acuerdo una garantia de que las ambas partes no hagan el trabajo negativo a la normalizacion de la ZIK, en el sentido de sacar juntos las lecciones en el  presente caso y no hacer en el futuro otros  trabajos negativos porque en el tema de prevenir el relanzamiento del caso no tiene fin para aclarar la causa de la congelacion de la ZIK y distinguir la responsabilidad por el respecto y a su vez la parte nortena tiene mas palabras que la surena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el tema de paso, comunicacion y entrada de aduana, la parte nortena propuso esforzarse en comun ambas partes y discutir las medidas entre otras la garantia suficiente de comunicacion como via Internet y telefono movil, la simplificacion de proceso y la disminucion de tiempo de la entrada de aduana, y en el caso de las medidas de garantia militar, encomendar a las autoridades militares de ambas partes para que las consulten y solucionen en las conversaciones de trabajo militar Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY presento ademas una idea racional para preparar aparatos institucionales como reanudar la oficina de consulta de las cooperaciones economicas Norte-Sur para debatir y solucionar los problemas que surjan en la operacion de la ZIK, organizar y poner en funcionamiento el comite comun y establecer los subcomites necesarios adscritos a este comite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando en consideracion la solicitud de los empresarios surcoreanos de reiniciar cuanto antes la ZIK para disminuir al maximo los danos empresariales, planteo reiteradamente impulsar simultanea y generalmente todas las medidas para el reinicio y la normalizacion de la ZIK y al respecto de la firma de acuerdo  propuso firmarlo por encargo los jefes que son partes de consultas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la parte surena, al dar espalda a los esfuerzos sinceros de su contraparte por lograr el fruto de las conversaciones, no doblego sus insistencias tercas diciendo que la parte nortena tiene culpa por la suspension de la ZIK, razon por la cual debe recompensar los danos, lo que es su invariable posicion y anadio que no habra la normalizacion de la ZIK si el Norte no la acepta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY se aferro a la tactica dilatoria abandonando el lugar de conversaciones antes de las 4:00 de la tarde.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque la parte nortena hizo todos los esfuerzos para prevenir el fracaso de la 6a ronda de las conversaciones y lograr el fruto, la parte surena la llevo por fin a la crisis de ruptura insistiendo en sus posiciones arrogantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInmediatamente, la parte norte sostuvo en el terreno una rueda de prensa, ocasion en la cual denuncio categoricamente las maniobras de la parte surena tendentes a romper las conversaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa parte surena nunca podra eludir las responsabilidades de las consecuencias que se emanen de la ruptura de las conversaciones."

            "content": "CRPP critica pedido surcoreano de posponer tiempo de traspaso de mando militar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 26 de julio (ACNC) -- El Secretariado del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria hizo publica el dia 26 la informacion no. 1039 denunciando a las autoridades surcoreanas que suplicaron a Estados Unidos aplazar el tiempo de traspaso del mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante la pasada guerra coreana, el traidor Syngman Rhee entrego a EE.UU. el mando de operaciones del ejercito titere surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInicialmente, el mando en cuestion debio ser devuelto a la parte surcoreana en 2012, pero fue aplazado para 2015 segun la peticion obstinada de la camarilla de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual mandataria surcoreana, que habia presentado como su promesa \"electoral\" por la presidencia el recibo del mando, expuso despues de su llegada al poder la posicion de \"promover segun lo programado el recibo del mando en el ano 2015\" y lo estipulo como tarea medular de su politica de diplomacia y seguridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, desoyendo la demanda de diferentes sectores sociales y faltando a su promesa electoral, las actuales autoridades surcoreanas volvieron a suplicar en secreto a sus amos gringos posponer nuevamente el tiempo de traspaso del mando so pretextos de \"armas nucleares del Norte de Corea\" y \"amenaza para la seguridad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas maniobras de los titeres surcoreanos para ese fin agravan la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y el Nordeste Asiatico y aumenta el peligro de guerra nuclear contra el Norte de Corea, comienza la informacion y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos tienen siniestra intencion de convertir el Sur de Corea en la base avanzada para realizar la estrategia norteamericana de dominar a Asia y lanzar el ejercito surcoreano como brigada de choque en las maniobras agresivas de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe lograrse el intento de la banda surcoreana de aplazar otra vez el traspaso, EE.UU. recrudecera sus acciones para provocar la guerra anti-RPDC y realizar la estrategia de hegemonia mundial controlando de continuo al Sur de Corea en el plano militar y persiguiendo la politica hostil a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente caso pone en claro la naturaleza vendepatria y antinacional del actual \"poder\" surcoreano, lacayo colonial que se mantiene de servilismo a EE.UU. y otras fuerzas foraneas y esta enfrascado en el enfrentamiento fratricida sin tomar en cuenta la dignidad ni los intereses de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una caricatura politica el hecho de que los titeres surcoreanos, que mantienen su vida precaria confiando su soberania militar a su amo, hablaran de supuesto \"pais avanzado\", \"rango del estado\" y \"dignidad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existe la pandilla de vendepatrias, el Sur de Corea no podra liberarse nunca de la mala fama de zona politicamente atrasada y colonia y los habitantes surcoreanos tampoco podran evitar las desgracias, sufrimientos y desastres de guerra."
