            "content": "DFRK Sends Open Letter to S. Korean People\r\n Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea Saturday sent an open letter to the south Korean people, calling upon all of them to turn out in a sacred war for throwing the traitors overboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation on the Korean Peninsula is now so tense that a war may break out right now due to the extremely escalated inter-Korean confrontation, the letter said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the puppet conservative group come to power than it trampled down upon all the achievements made since the June 15 joint declaration was published and rushed headlong into the confrontation with the DPRK. And it finally orchestrated such hideous charade as the case of the warship sinking, driving the inter-Korean relations to the present deplorable phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case was by no means accidental and it was not caused by anyone's military attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group orchestrated such shocking charade as the case of the warship sinking in collusion with foreign forces when it found it impossible to realize its scenario to bring the inter-Korean relations to a collapse in violation of the June 15 joint declaration, revive the pro-U.S. fascist dictatorship in south Korea and achieve its ambition for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group earned an ill-fame by importing beef from cattle infected with mad cow disease to take lives of people, and killing evacuees in Ryongsan. These fascist ogres did not hesitate to leave dozens of seamen of the puppet navy buried at sea for the purpose of faking up a conspiratorial case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors is busy telling lies and hatching plots against the south Korean people. Now is the time to properly discern who speaks truth and justice, tells lies and advocates injustice and who stands for peace and seeks confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group is one of heinous quislings and bandits without equals as it has brought only disasters and misfortune to this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"elections to local self-governing bodies\" soon to be held in south Korea is not a mere competition for winning votes between the ruling and opposition parties to seize the local power but crucial political confrontation deciding peace or war and democracy or fascism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear that if ballots are cast for the Lee group, this will help the departed soul of the fascist dictatorship raise its head higher and throw the economy and the people's livelihood into more serious bankruptcy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the escalated military tension leads to an armed conflict, it will bring unspeakable disasters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Votes for the Lee group mean ones for war and fascist dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Standing at this crucial crossroads of war and fascist dictatorship and peace and democracy you should make a right choice, not allow yourselves to be deceived again but sternly judge the group of traitors, bearing deep in mind the responsibility and mission you have assumed before history and the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the only way of preventing a war, saving peace, driving out fascism, regaining democracy and reviving the economy and people's livelihood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people in the DPRK express conviction and expectation that you, the south Korean people, will fully demonstrate their stamina in the forthcoming \"elections\" by carrying forward with pride the glorious tradition of their struggle."

            "content": "Military Commentator on Truth behind \"Story of Attack by North\" (2)\r\n Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- A military commentator Tuesday released an article in connection with the south Korean regime's allegation about the north's \"torpedo attack\" on south Korean warship \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Following is the second part of the article:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Are the investigation results scientific and objective?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime said that mobilized in the probe into the incident were a \"civilian-military joint investigation team\" involving 25 experts from 10 professional organs, 22 military experts and 3 members from the \"National Assembly\", and an \"international joint investigation team\" made up of 24 experts from the United States, Britain and other countries, so that the investigation results were worked out in a scientific, objective and exact way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is the point here is who was in charge of the investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the south Korean puppet military that are to blame for the incident. But the very one responsible for the incident took charge of the investigation, reminding one of a criminal investigating into his own crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the investigation undertaken by those who should have been brought to justice, its results were a matter of course.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A person who took part in the investigation said, \"The results of the investigation are not reliable as it was superintended by the military responsible for the incident\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"international joint investigation team\", advertised by the south Korean regime, was made up of those from such allies of south Korea as the United States, Britain and Australia from whom it was hard to expect objectivity in investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In some sense, it seems that they gathered to serve as supporters in the drama played by the south Korean regime and seek an excuse for escalating international pressure on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the investigation results been released than the afore-said countries kicked off a new wave of the anti-DPRK campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the \"civilian-military joint investigation team\", there is enough ground for controversy as to how significant the role played by some civilians in the investigation was.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The carefully selected civilians were not allowed to use their mobile phones but compelled to make a written pledge to observe secrecy and stay in warship \"Tokdo\" until the end of the investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One of them was excluded from the investigation team and prosecuted for the reason that he failed to agree with the \"Defence Ministry\" in its allegation about the \"torpedo attack by the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It stands to reason that many experts think the impartiality and objectivity of the investigation are out of the question since it was undertaken by the military responsible for the incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the view of the world public that nobody knows better than the south Korean military about the cause of the incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before the occurrence of the incident, the vessel in question navigated towards the 25 meters deep water area, out of its regular route, at the risk of stranding. After the incident occurred, its survivals were all confined to a military hospital for \"mental stress\" with gag placed on their mouth. They were not allowed to use mobile phone and contact the outside. The vessel's log, communication record and photos have not been made public for the reason of \"military secret\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military made five different announcements about the spot of the incident and the captain of the vessel first denied the likelihood of others' provocation and then reversed his original statement. The detected powder was first announced to be RDX but later it was changed into TNT allegedly used in such countries as Russia, China and north Korea. And the military stated that there is no ground that the incident was caused by the north's attack but later insisted on the story about the \"north's torpedo attack\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Materials used in the investigation are mainly related to the military.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The survivals said in their \"official testimony\" that they heard explosion sound one or two times and a private said his face was splashed with water drops when he fell down by a shock. A guard alleged he saw a nearly 100-metre-high column of water for two or three seconds at night from Paekryong Island. All their remarks were needed to prove an underwater explosion. And the autopsy of the dead was done with no access to civilians. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The activities of the investigation team were reported every day only to the \"minister of Defence\" and the \"chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With Lee Myung Bak, Chong Un Chan, Won Se Hun and other evaders of the military service taking top positions in south Korea such as \"president\", \"prime minister\" and \"director of the National Intelligence Service\", the military have been in high feather, far from feeling a sense of sin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many significant and scientific materials concerning the cause of the incident were raised during the investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A sea rescue expert with a 30-odd-year-long career reportedly proved that the vessel was sunken through its carelessness. When the stern of the vessel was pulled up, he, in view of large scratches on it and the dead in underwear, judged that it ran on a rock. According to his opinion, the survivals have been forced to refrain from clarifying the truth.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that there are rocks in the water area has been confirmed by the chief of the south Korea maritime police through a submarine map and by fishermen. But they were charged with their telling the truth by the \"Defence Security Command\", the police and \"government officials\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The maritime police said \"Rescue us from stranding\" is the first message they received from the navy after the incident happened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some people, including a former army chief of staff, have guessed that if the vessel was sunken by an outside shock, it might be hit through mistake by a U.S. warship or fighter plane mobilized in military maneuvers in the water area at that time and that a recruit might set off an explosive to kill himself in protest against harsh treatment including beating.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by the development, the south Korean regime killed all the speculations and opinions against its scenario, resorting to every conceivable means including threat and blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the investigation took place in such a way as substantiating the regime's far-fetched allegation, not in a scientific, neutral and objective way backed by real evidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is illustrated by the materials presented by the south Korean regime that the investigation was intentionally directed towards the sinking of the vessel by the north's torpedo attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the incident happened, the regime referred to the likeliness that it was caused by a mine as the United States laid 500-600 mines in the sea to protect a radar set on Paekryong Island in the 1960s and that the vessel was so old that it was sunken by itself. According to families of the missing crewmen, the old vessel underwent repairs several times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It ruled out the possibility of the incident caused by a torpedo, noting that the engine sound of a launched torpedo cannot evade radar and that a submarine cannot easily move while a torpedo can easily be detected, as the water area is so shallow. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime also said there was no special move of the north, a meaning that there was no ground of the north's involvement in the incident. In actuality, it did not place into operation Watch Condition, an anti-north monitoring system which had been at work whenever the situation became tense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the lapse of time, the \"story about the north's involvement in the incident\" has come out from the regime gradually but persistently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The story was hyped up to be the \"north's direct involvement\" and then the \"north's torpedo attack\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, evidence pieces which may refute the north's involvement in the incident went into oblivion one after another or were strictly excluded from the objects of investigation. Typical of them is a gas turbine, a main piece of evidence which can help clarify the cause of the incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The turbine must have gone down vertically when the vessel was broken and sunken. So it might take no much time and effort to detect and pull up it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the regime, well aware that the turbine was submerged under the spot, intentionally gave up the effort for searching it, alleging that it was carried away by an explosion, because the condition of the turbine would serve as a decisive clue in clarifying the cause of the incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the turbine was discovered by a fisherman, it was compelled to pull it up a day before the announcement of the investigation results.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts indicate that the investigation was carried out in a far-fetched and one-sided way, not in a scientific way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. \"Story about the north's torpedo attack\" is what the south Korean regime invented to seek a way out of its crisis through fiction of threat from the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Plot-hatching is an attribute and mode of existence for confrontation-maniacs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Frankly speaking, if the officers of vessel did not have life boats and vests all to themselves and if they did something to rescue the others with the stern, not the main part, of the vessel burst, the 46 young privates would have never lost their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An inhabitant on Paekryong Island said, \"I have never seen a patrol craft approaching that close\". And a military expert said the vessel's approach close to the \"northern limit line\" is a provocation of the \"Defence Ministry\" against the north, expressing a suspicion that it was put under water premeditatedly for a certain purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Just after the vessel was submerged, another patrol boat recklessly fired some 130 shells towards the north. It became clear later that the firing was planned in advance by the south Korean authorities and military. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the south Korean people were disturbed in mind over the incident, the captain of the vessel appeared, in a gala dress unsuitable for the tragedy, at a briefing for the families of those reported missing, striking the participants speechless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His behavior added to the suspicion that the incident was a cold-blooded farce architected by the \"pragmatic government\" of south Korea in a bid to prop up itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean progressives, opposition parties, civic and social organizations and even those concerned in the \"civilian-military joint investigation team\" have ridiculed the investigation results as \"crude and brazen-faced fraud motivated by an political intention\", \"farce aimed to win the forthcoming election by making much ado about threat from the north\" and the \"last of a serial fiction\". A poll taken by a south Korean conservative press organ showed that a half of the pollees -- those above the level of university graduate and those of twenties -- disavowed the investigation results.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After cooking up such mean and clumsy charade, the south Korean regime is working with bloodshot eyes to peddle the fiction of threat from the north, defying scientific evidence and objective procedures. This desperate effort of the regime is aimed to save itself from the present crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean political situation has run into an unprecedented crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the regime, on the basis of the alliance with the United States, has pursued pro-U.S. policies since it came to power, south Korea has further reduced to a colony of the United States, harassed by the regime's anti-popular policies and fascist dictatorship, and inter-Korean relations have reached the worst phase owing to its policy of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it is proved that the incident was caused by the vessel's mistake or accident of unknown origin, public anger will surely overthrow the regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Public opinion is that the incident may possibly lead to breaking south Korean society itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The effect of the incident is enough to deliver a serious defeat to the regime in June 2 elections to the local self-governing bodies and, furthermore, spoil the conservatives' desire to remain in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not fortuitous that the regime announced the investigation results the day when the election campaign started officially, after preparing such things as announcement of the cause of the incident, presidential statement and Defence Ministry statement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The incident the regime has linked with the DPRK is also related to outstanding military issues between south Korea and the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States plans to transfer in form the \"right to command the wartime operation\" to south Korea in 2012 for the sake of its strategic interests and rearrange its forces in south Korea under the pretext of \"strategic flexibility\" for the purpose of immediately dispatching them to hot spots of the world any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime that already agreed with the plan is now pleading the United States to rectify it out of the desire to keep the U.S. forces in south Korea and invade the north with their help.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it vociferates about \"threat from the north\" and \"instability\" on the Korean peninsula by shoving off the responsibility for the incident to the north, it would be possible for the regime to keep the U.S. forces remaining in south Korea. This is what the regime wants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime finds a way out in laying the blame for the incident on the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even if the vessel met a misfortune for its aging or its own mistake, Lee Myung Bak and the military top brass are entirely accountable for the incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the incident, families of the missing crewmen have upbraided the regime for having failed to properly repair the aged vessel on a regular basis though it has collected heavy taxes from the people. They have also lambasted it for making a lie. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the \"National Assembly\", taking issue with the \"Defence Ministry\" on slack military discipline and irresponsible maintenance of military equipment, has set up a special inspection body to reprimand the top brass. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean people are urging Lee Myung Bak to make an apology and the regime to step down for the tragic incident caused by the poor system for coping with crisis and for the loose security system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"story about the torpedo attack by the north\" is just what the regime invented to seek a way out of its serious crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. The DPRK will react to \"retaliation\" with stronger retaliation and to \"punishment\" with indiscriminate punishment of its own style. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After working out a military plot unprecedented in the history of inter-Korean relations, the south Korean regime is now out of all reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak, at a \"meeting of major commanding officers of the army\", incited anti-communist confrontation, talking about \"practical and tough measures\". In the wake of his remarks, such conservatives as Kim Thae Yong, Ryu Myong Hwan and Hyon In Thaek have joined in the racket, clamoring about \"decisive punishment\" and \"due compensation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime has sent its officials to the United States and many other countries to convince them that Cheonan was sunken by the north and refer the incident to the United Nations Security Council. In this way it is seeking to see the north put again in the \"list of terrorism sponsors\" and have international sanctions intensified against it. For this purpose, the regime has made no scruple of making concessions in the issues of troop dispatch to Afghanistan and the south Korea-U.S. free trade agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At Lee's beck and call, the south Korean military have launched a \"50-day program for victory\", terming the day of the incident a \"day of disgrace\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have also held war confabs one after another and projected large-scale joint submarine exercises in the West Sea with the mobilization of a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine, and the resuming of anti-DPRK broadcasting in the frontline areas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the south Korean regime has made and distributed videos slandering the north over the incident and threatened to bar the passage of the north's ships through the Jeju Straits and totally block inter-Korean economic cooperation and interchange including the business in the Kaesong Industrial Zone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has charged anyone with opinion different from the investigation results with being \"communists\" and \"pro-north elements\", vowing a tough action against \"abuses of the results\" and \"illegal meetings\". It has also arrested those who spread doubts about the investigation results and even criticized other countries which have failed to support them, for siding with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such a frantic anti-north campaign of the south Korean regime has been stimulated by the United States.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the vessel was sunken, the U.S. imperialists asserted that the DPRK was involved in the incident. They have instigated the south Korean regime to confrontation with the north, calling the investigation trustworthy and voicing support to its results.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as the investigation results and presidential statement came out in south Korea, the United States expressed support to them and its willingness to continue cooperation in policy towards the north. It, through a joint meeting of those from the departments of the State and Defence and the Central Intelligence Agency, discussed forming a special inspection team through the \"UN Command\" in name only and dealing with the incident through the non-existent \"Military Armistice Commission\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces in south Korea have taken a combat posture after the 8th Army Command turned into a \"war command\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts prove that the \"story about the north's torpedo attack\" is, indeed, a despicable farce orchestrated by the south Korean regime to harm the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The brigandish farce is a hideous crime to be recorded in the history of inter-Korean relations as it is an open negation and total rejection of the June 15 era of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK already removed the south Korean traitors, including Lee Myung Bak, from the list of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Crime and penalty stem from the same trunk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless confrontation row kicked off by the Lee Myung Bak regime has only resulted in fuelling resentment against the traitors and determination to punish them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are sharply watching the moves of the south Korean regime to stifle the fellow countrymen in the north and keeping themselves ready to take decisive counteractions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean regime shows any slightest sign of provocation, political, military or economic, against the DPRK, backed by the U.S. imperialists, they will immediately and strongly react to it, eliminate all the traitors to the nation from the Korean peninsula and build a rich and powerful country, reunified Korea where all the people enjoy prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is a saying that regime is temporary and nation is everlasting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never deal with south Korea as long as Lee Myung Bak, an anti-north fanatic, remains in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History and truth are always bound to be clarified and tricksters will not be able to escape a stern judgment of justice regardless of prescription."

It forged what it called \"evidence proving the above-said assertion\" with supposition, speculation and random guess. After producing fragments and pieces of aluminum as \"evidence\" though nobody could tell whether they were collected from a dumping ground or not, the group let loose a spate of rubbish, talking about \"analysis of ingredient\" and \"size and form\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group found out and salvaged a gas turbine just one day before it announced the \"results of investigation\". It is easy to guess why the group spent so much time to find out the gas turbine, why it did not let foreign experts involve themselves in the investigation into the gas turbine and why it so hurriedly announced the said results, ignoring the assertion of the opposition camp demanding the probe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts go to clearly prove that the case of the warship sinking is a sheer fabrication made by the south Korean ruling forces, a hideous burlesque orchestrated by them for confrontation with the DPRK in collusion with foreign forces to stir up the atmosphere of escalated confrontation with it and ignite a war of aggression against it."

And it was hoping to settle the issue of its military base in Okinawa before late May. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the U.S. and south Korea might have cooked up the case to achieve their political purposes. They might turn their faces away from the death of seamen. The U.S. and south Korea will sooner or later find themselves in such a position where they will lift axes only to drop them on their feet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The May 22nd issue of Reference News of China quoted a Russian expert on submarine as saying when interviewed by a reporter: It is hard to believe the \"results of investigation\". If \"Cheonan\" did not spot a sub or a torpedo of the rival party when it was approaching the warship, then the south Korean seamen might be called fools. The recent case is very strange.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russian media also cast doubts as to the above-said \"results of the investigation.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Internet media Newsland on May 24 commented as follows: The story that \"Cheonan\" was sunken by a submarine of the DPRK does not sound plausible. The U.S. forces and the south Korean army might have spotted the submarine of the DPRK any moment as they were conducting anti-sub exercises in the waters where the case occurred. There were warships equipped with expensive Aegis systems in the waters the moment the case took place. Then why did the DPRK's sub send to the bottom of the sea \"Cheonan\" of south Korea only, instead of striking warships and nuclear-powered subs equipped with Aegis? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also took note of the fact that the U.S. issued a statement calling for investigation into the DPRK's involvement in the case right after the sinking of the warship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ria-Novosti News on the same day said that many south Koreans were skeptical about the \"results of the investigation\" into the case which escalated the tensions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean media are paying attention to the fact that the part of the wrecked torpedo where the rust had been removed was marked with \"No. 1\" with a blue felt-tip pen and \"number\" is marked in the DPRK in its own style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"results of investigation\" claimed that the north Korean submarine entered the territorial waters of south Korea two or three days before the occurrence of the case. But it is doubtful how it could have made its appearance so stealthily at a time when \"Cheonan\" tasked to spot subs was conducting joint military exercises with warships of the U.S. forces they claim equipped with the ultra-modern early detection means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it had been true, it only indicates how weak the joint defence provided by powerful \"military allies\" is before a single submarine as they spend a fabulous amount of fund for that purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Golos Russii on May 25 observed: The \"team for investigation into the case\" was not in a legitimate international position. The fact that it was formed by prejudiced south Korea should have been clarified before anything else. Even the public of south Korea are getting doubtful about the \"objectivity\" of the investigation. Analysts asserted that there were many things doubtful including the marking of the wrecked torpedo, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The May 26th issue of Rossiskaya Gazeta said not a single member of an international inspection group was allowed to witness the salvaging of the wreckage of \"Cheonan\", adding that the \"evidence\" produced by south Korea is absolutely unbelievable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Komsomolskaya Pravda posted on Internet on the same day the following remarks made by a captain of the General Staff of the Russian Navy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Russian Navy considers that the recent case is very close to \"a clumsy farce\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, what is marked on the wrecked torpedo is completely not in line with the markings of torpedoes of the DPRK Navy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems that all \"material evidence\" were cooked up in great haste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent case is a fabrication of those keen to deceive the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is a \"competent\" director in this field.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is the need to recall that the U.S. deceived the UN with false information before launching its Iraqi war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is strong feeling that the \"Cheonan\" case is also a work done by the U.S."

He aqui la razon por la cual publico en mayo el \"resultado de investigacion\" del incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tercero, procuro el pretexto para justificar su politica de \"paciencia estrategica\" encaminada a destruir el ambiente de inversion internacional sobre la RPDC y asfixiar de manera sostenida la economia de esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuarto, hizo caer a China en una situacion incomoda y pudo reforzar su control sobre sus lacayos: Japon y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por mucho que EE.UU. convierta lo negro en lo blanco, la verdad no cambiara nunca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. habla mucho de que llevaria el presente caso al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, pero este espacio fue ensuciado ya en febrero de 2003 por las mentiras de Powell sobre Irak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Resulta contradictorio que EE.UU. insistiera por conducto de las autoridades surcoreanas en abordar el presente caso en la \"Comision Militar de Armisticio\" describiendolo como \"violacion del Acuerdo de Armisticio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este acuerdo se hizo un papel mojado hace mucho tiempo por culpa de EE.UU. Ademas, la \"Comision Militar de Armisticio\" se mantiene paralizada desde cuando EE.UU. retiro unilateralmente al miembro en jefe de la parte de las \"fuerzas de la ONU\" y ubico en su puesto a un \"general\" del ejercito titere surcoreano que no es la parte signataria del citado acuerdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aun antes de que la parte de las \"fuerzas de la ONU\" de la Comision Militar de Armisticio anunciara investigar si hubo o no la violacion del Acuerdo de Armisticio en el incidente del \"Cheonan\", el gobierno norteamericano saco la conclusion de que si hubo la \"violacion\". Este hecho es una buena prueba de cuan nominal es ese aparato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es muy lamentable que la secretaria de Estado de EE.UU. hablara del Acuerdo de Armisticio sin saber en que situacion esta este pacto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al defender activamente el \"resultado de investigacion\" del Sur de Corea, EE.UU. impone a otros paises que lo acepten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, la naturaleza del \"grupo de investigacion\" organizado por EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas es tan intransparente como una sombra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El problema no esta solo en que ese grupo fue compuesto principalmente con el personal del circulo militar surcoreano sino tambien en que las autoridades surcoreanas atribuyeron al grupo la dimension \"internacional\" en alusion a unos extranjeros seleccionados unilateralmente por si mismas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No se conocio ningun detalle de que si esos extranjeros participaron en la investigacion representando al gobierno de sus respectivos paises o en privado, si tenian realmente la facultad de investigar o eran testaferros y con que procedimiento acordaron el \"resultado de investigacion\". Tiene que ver con esto la obstinada negativa de EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas a la propuesta formulada repetidamente por la RPDC de enviar al lugar de los hechos el grupo de inspeccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tan pronto como fuera publicado el \"resultado de investigacion\", EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas se precipitan para aplicar la sancion y las medidas correspondientes, independientemente de que lo admita o no el mundo. Todo esto demuestra claramente que ellos tienen otro objetivo y se mueven segun el guion ya elaborado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Estaria muy equivocado EE.UU. si piensa tomar toda la Peninsula Coreana con una mentira como lo hizo con Irak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU pone a debate el \"resultado de investigacion\" del caso del \"Cheonan\" volviendo a ser enganado por las mentiras de EE.UU., esto se considerara que ese organismo se usa en atentar contra la dignidad del pueblo coreano y la soberania de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En caso de que nuestro pais tome las contramedidas superduras para la autodefensa ya anunciadas, EE.UU. y sus lacayos asumiran la responsabilidad entera de las consecuencias que emanen de ello."

Y dice que por esta razon, es \"cientifico\" y \"objetivo\" el resultado de investigacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que debemos analizar primero es quien es el encargado de la investigacion del caso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl responsable del caso es precisamente el circulo militar surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, esa investigacion resulto la \"pesquisa del delincuente sobre su propio crimen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa estaba manifestado desde el comienzo ese resultadito, porque la investigacion estuvo a cargo de los gangsteres del circulo militar que debieron comparecer esposados ante el tribunal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn participante en la investigacion apunto que \"no se puede confiar en la investigacion, porque es auspiciada por el ejercito, responsable principal del caso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos hablan con bombo y platillo del \"grupo de investigacion conjunta internacional\" aludiendo a la participacion de los expertos extranjeros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes preguntamos con cuanta objetividad habran procedido los investigadores de EE.UU., Gran Bretana y Australia si estos paises son \"amigos fuertes\" de los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este sentido, se puede decir que esos paises son unas moscas congregadas para jugar el papel de testigo en el complot orquestado por los titeres surcoreanos y para procurar el pretexto de aplastamiento a la RPDC en el ambito internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cloaca, que atrae las moscas, siempre apesta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPracticamente, tan pronto como se publicara ese imperfecto resultado, dichos paises andan ajetreados levantando la gran oleada anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora nos toca analizar la situacion de los investigadores civiles del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA estos investigadores \"seleccionados rigurosamente\" se les prohibieron el uso de telefonos celulares y la salida y se les impuso que juraran por escrito \"guardar el secreto\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta el final de la investigacion, no pudieron actuar libremente siendo encerrados en el buque de de guerra \"Tokdo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA citar un buen ejemplo de ello, un investigador fue excluido del grupo de investigacion y acusado finalmente a la fiscalia por la unica razon de no ajustar su criterio al tono de hablar del \"Ministerio de Defensa Nacional\" para acusar al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs sumamente natural que los especialistas evaluaran al unisono que \"la imparcialidad y la objetividad se han marchado ya cuando la investigacion se asigno al ejercito que debe someterse al interrogatorio como responsable del accidente\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo presta ahora mucha atencion al hecho de que el circulo militar surcoreano conoce mejor que nadie la causa de hundimiento del \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMerece la polemica el hecho de que este buque se desvio de su habitual ruta de desplazamiento y se metio a \"riesgo de varada\" en la zona del siniestro con una profundidad de apenas 25 metros que no era su teatro operacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCausa la risa la orden de guardar el silencio que se emitio a los supervivientes quienes fueron hospitalizados en colectivo en un hospital militar bajo el pretexto de que sufren el \"estres mental\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, fueron confiscados sus telefonos celulares y se les prohibio el contacto con la parte exterior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, el ejercito titere surcoreano no publico los registros de navegacion y comunicaciones y los materiales filmicos de cuando sucedio el incidente por el concepto de \"secreto militar\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos datos bastan para conocer las \"angustias del ejercito surcoreano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara aclarar el punto del siniestro, el ejercito surcoreano tuvo que publicar mas de 5 comunicados diferentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl capitan del \"Cheonan\", quien habia afirmado que no hubo ninguna \"provocacion\" desde el exterior, cambio su parecer diciendo que \"si la hubo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl circulo militar surcoreano, que al principio, sostenia que la \"polvora extracta\" fue la dinamita de alta potencia RDX usada por todo el mundo, la alteraron luego como TNT que \"se usa en Rusia, China, el Norte de Corea, etc.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, si bien habia publicado directamente que \"no hay ningun fundamento sobre el ataque del Norte\", insistio de repente lo contrario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos supervivientes declararon oficialmente que han escuchado una o dos veces la explosion y un soldado caido al suelo por el impacto de la explosion dijo que salpico su cara una gota de agua. Si bien los titeres habian afirmado al principio que no hubo ningun testigo presencial de la columna de agua, aparecio luego un centinela de la isla Paekryong, lejana al lugar del accidente, quien confirmo la explosion debajo del mar alegando haber visto durante 2 y 3 segundos a pesar de la oscuridad una columna blanca de agua de unos 100 metros de altura. Por concepto de \"secreto militar\", se realizaron en el estado practicamente hermetico el analisis del estado alterado del casco del buque, las declaraciones de los hombres involucrados y la autopsia de los cadaveres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos estos datos utilizados en la investigacion estan relacionados en su mayoria con el ejercito surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl trabajo del \"grupo de investigacion conjunta de civiles y militares\" fue regido por un sistema de informacion diaria y directa al ministro de Defensa Nacional y al jefe de la junta de jefes de estado mayor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que la cupula militar surcoreana esta formada por los tipejos, que evadieron el servicio militar y no saben ni jota de los asuntos militares, como el traidor Lee Myung Bak, el primer ministro Jong Un Chan y el presidente del Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia, Won Se Hun, es comprensible que los compinches militares actuaran asi a su antojo, lejos de sentirse culpables por el incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el curso de investigacion fueron presentados insoslayables datos cientificos sobre la causa del accidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn especialista, quien se dedico durante mas de 30 anos al socorro maritimo, dijo que al ver salir a la superficie del agua la popa del \"Cheonan\", se dio cuenta en el acto de que este sufrio la varada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara argumentar que este buque no fue hundido en un caso de emergencia sino por una causa interna, el cito varios datos concretos como la gran rasgadura dejada en la armadura del buque y la muerte de los desaparecidos en ropa interior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProsiguio que los supervivientes no declaran la varada con el unico fin de ocultar la verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl director de la policia maritima titere tambien reconocio la existencia de los escollos puntiagudos en la zona de siniestro que quedan sumergidos en el tiempo de marea alta diciendo que lo constata el mapa de ambiente submarino y preguntandose por que la \"Comandancia Militar de Defensa y Seguridad\", la policia y los \"miembros del gobierno\" estan presionando a los pescadores locales por decir la verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa policia maritima confeso que la primera peticion de socorro recibida por parte de las fuerzas navales fue \"!Auxilio! Varada\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOtras figuras como el ex jefe del estado mayor de las fuerzas terrestres opinan que si el buque \"Cheonan\" fue hundido por el impacto desde el exterior, es posible que haya sido bombardeado por error por un buque de guerra o avion de combate de EE.UU. que realizaban en clima de guerra real un ejercicio belico en el momento del estallido del incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, presentan la hipotesis de que el \"descontento acumulado de un marinero dentro del buque\" fuera la causa de hundimiento calificandolo como el \"incidente del soldado de primera Kim ocurrido en las fuerzas navales\". Cansado de haber recibido golpes y maltratos inhumanos, el exploto una dinamita para suicidarse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPerpleja ante esta corriente de la situacion, la camarilla de traidores descarto tajantemente varias conjeturas y opiniones que no convenian a su guion y uso durante todo el curso de investigacion todos los medios de control enganando y chantajeando a los hombres para fines politicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, la investigacion no resulto un proceso cientifico, neutral y basado en las pruebas y se llevo a cabo bajo la \"censura\" en direccion de defender el rumor malintencionado, parcial y absurdo del \"ataque torpedero del Norte\" inventado por los maniacos de confrontacion con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo comprueban los datos presentados al principio, en el tiempo intermedio y hasta la fecha por los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl principio del incidente, ellos presentaron la posibilidad del \"accidente a causa de la mina\" en alusion a 500-600 minas que habia colocado EE.UU. en la decada de 1960 para proteger la base de radar en la isla Paekryong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlantearon tambien la posibilidad de \"destruccion natural\" de acuerdo con la opinion de los familiares de los desaparecidos de que el \"Cheonan\" estaba demasiado \"envejecido\" y fue reparado en varias ocasiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, rehusaron la \"posibilidad del accidente a causa de torpedo\" explicando que a diferencia de la bala que navega rapido en el aire, el torpedo se mueve despacio en el mar y es imposible que los detectores acusticos no hubieran captado el ruido de su motor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAseguraron tambien que puesto que la zona maritima del accidente es de muy poca profundidad, es muy dificil para una lancha submarina desplazarse ahi y resulta muy facil detectar un torpedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a su anuncio de que \"no se reportaron movimientos insolitos del Norte\" en el momento del incidente, dijeron que eso significaba que \"no hay la razon de suponer la participacion del Norte en el hundimiento\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, ellos no han puesto en operacion el sistema de vigilancia al Norte llamado \"Watch Condition\" que activaban cada vez que la situacion se tornaba tensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, con el paso del tiempo, el \"rumor de vinculacion del Norte con el incidente\", que comenzo a circular con mucho cuidado, paso al de \"participacion directa del Norte\" que finalmente se convirtio en el de \"ataque torpedero del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl contrario, las pruebas, que niegan la vinculacion de la RPDC con el incidente, se desaparecieron una tras otra o han sido excluidas de la agenda de investigacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntre ellas esta la turbina de gas, prueba medular de la causa del incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa turbina de gas debio ser sumergida en el lugar del accidente cuando el buque \"Cheonan\" se partio en dos. Por lo tanto, la localizacion de ella no requeria mucho tiempo y tampoco era un problema sacarla a flote.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque lo sabian bien desde el principio, los titeres surcoreanos circularon el falso rumor de que \"la turbina de gas se perdio por la explosion\" y \"se abstuvieron\" intencionalmente de su busqueda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta conducta se debe al hecho de que el estado de la turbina de gas permite juzgar facilmente la causa de hundimiento y a la gran preocupacion de ellos de que se echara por tierra su complot para imputar la responsabilidad a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando otros investigadores localizaron la turbina de gas, ellos la sacaron a flote a desgana un dia antes de la \"publicacion del resultado de investigacion gubernamental\" para que no se reflejaran concretamente en este los resultados de investigacion de esa pieza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos muestran que la investigacion no se llevo a cabo como pregonan los traidores surcoreanos, o sea, de manera cientifica y objetiva sino a modo de manipular los detalles a su capricho y a base de prejuicio y arbitrariedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Rumor de \"ataque torpedero del Norte\" es para levantar la \"oleada contra el Norte\" y salir de la crisis\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conspiracion y el complot constituyen el atributo natural y el modo de subsistencia de los maniacos de confrontacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancamente dicho, ya que la explosion tuvo lugar no en la parte vulnerable del buque sino en su popa, si los oficiales no se hubieran lanzado al mar llevandose el bote y todos los chalecos salvavidas como si supieran de antemano del accidente y hubieran realizado el rescate, no habria esa tragica muerte de 46 soldados jovenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn morador nacido en la isla Paekryong dijo que \"nunca ha visto antes un buque patrullero que se ha acercado tanto como el ´Cheonan´\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn experto de asuntos militares expreso su temor a que el hundimiento fuera un accidente artificial que persigue cierto objetivo calificando la aparicion del \"Cheonan\" en las cercanias de la \"linea de limite al Norte\" de \"provocacion del Ministerio de Defensa Nacional igual a poner el punal en las narices del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuedo confirmado luego que inmediatamente despues del incidente, el buque patrullero surcoreano \"Sokcho\" disparo hacia el Norte mas de 130 obuses no por su confusion con la supuesta banda de pajaros sino segun el plan premeditadamente trazado por las autoridades titeres y el ejercito del Sur de Corea para \"imputar la responsabilidad al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando todo el territorio surcoreano estaba apesadumbrado por el incidente, el capitan del buque siniestrado comparecio en el encuentro con los familiares de los desaparecidos en \"vestidos muy elegantes\" como si no hubiera sufrido la tragedia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto contribuyo a aumentar la sospecha de que el hundimiento del buque \"Cheonan\" por una causa desconocida no fuera acaso el complot del \"gobierno pragmatista\", caido ahora en el atolladero, para alargar los dias contados de su vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas progresistas, los partidos opositores, las entidades civiles y sociales del Sur de Corea y hasta los relacionados con el \"grupo de investigacion conjunta de civiles y militares\" criticaron mordazmente el resultado de investigacion calificandolo de \"farsa pueril y cinica con fines politicos\", \"complot para la campana electoral y la ´oleada anti-Norte´\" y \"edicion final de una novela de ciencia ficcion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la encuesta realizada por un medio de prensa conservador, la mitad de los hombres eruditos, que se graduaron de las universidades o de los superiores centros de educacion, y de los encuestados de unos 20 anos de edad se niegan al resultado de investigacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema es que por que los titeres habran inventado esa farsa y estaran tan enloquecidos por circular ese rumor anti-Norte despreciando las pruebas cientificas y el procedimiento objetivo de la investigacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una palabra, lo hacen para salir de la crisis que enfrentan ahora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor cierto, la situacion politica del Sur de Corea esta empantanada ahora en una crisis sin precedente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde su llegada al poder, los titeres surcoreanos recurrieron a la dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras practicando el favoritismo a EE.UU. segun la doctrina de \"la alianza Sur de Corea-EE.UU. es todopoderosa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado, ha ido de mal en peor la colonizacion del suelo surcoreano por EE.UU., y el Sur de Corea se ha convertido en un infierno donde valen unicamente las politicas antipopulares y la dictadura fascista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, debido a la brutal politica de enfrentamiento, las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas llegaron a la fase irremediable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClaro esta que de confirmarse que el hundimiento del \"Cheonan\" se debe a un error interno o a una causa desconocida, el pueblo montado en colera acabara con el traidor Lee Myung Bak, \"maximo comandante del ejercito\", y sus compinches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion publica comenta que es muy probable que el incidente del buque \"Cheonan\" fragmente en dos o tres partes todo el territorio surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecificamente, este incidente bastaba para hacer sufrir a la banda de traidores una gran derrota en las \"elecciones locales\" del proximo 2 de junio y el consiguiente fracaso de las fuerzas conservadoras en la retoma del poder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, de acuerdo con el programa de \"publicacion de la causa-declaracion del presidente-comunicado del Ministerio de Defensa Nacional\" trazado en una sala recondita, la camarilla de titeres surcoreanos publico ese \"resultado de investigacion\" justamente en la primera jornada de su campana oficial para las \"elecciones locales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl polemico resultado tiene que ver tambien con el problema militar pendiente entre el Sur de Corea y EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPartiendo de sus intereses estrategicos, EE.UU. planea entregar formalmente en 2012 el \"mando de las operaciones en el tiempo de guerra\" a los titeres surcoreanos y reorganizar sus tropas estacionadas en el suelo surcoreano bajo la consigna de \"flexibilidad estrategica\" con el fin de despacharlas en cualquier momento a las zonas litigiosas del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos traidores surcoreanos, que se mantienen apoyandose en EE.UU., se pusieron de acuerdo al principio con la transferencia del \"mando\", pero al darse cuenta de que sin las tropas norteamericanas no pueden realizar su ambicion de agredir al Norte, comenzaron a suplicar al segundo para que reajustara ese acuerdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ahi que pensaron que si atribuyen el hundimiento del \"Cheonan\" al ataque de la RPDC, podrian impedir la salida de las tropas norteamericanas propagando con bombo y platillo la \"teoria de amenaza del Norte\" y la \"inestabilidad\" de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl traidor Lee Myung Bak y los cabecillas del circulo militar surcoreano son totalmente responsables de las otras posibles causas como el envejecimiento del buque y la varada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando sucedio el incidente, se les cayo la avalancha de criticas de parte de los familiares de los desaparecidos quienes revelaron que la camarilla de traidores no tomo las medidas de reparacion regular malgastando por otra parte el astronomico monto de impuestos recaudados al pueblo y por eso el \"Cheonan\" estaba muy deteriorado que penetraba el agua en su interior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"Asamblea Nacional\" del Sur de Corea tambien dirige su flecha al circulo militar, a saber, cuestiono la \"aflojada disciplina militar\" y la \"irresponsable administracion de equipos\" del \"Ministerio de Defensa Nacional\" e instauro hasta el \"comite de inspeccion especial\" para destituir a los cabecillas militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes de diferentes sectores de la sociedad surcoreana demandan fuertemente la disculpa del traidor Lee Myung Bak y la renuncia general de la banda de traidores deplorando que el incidente del \"Cheonan\" es una gran tragedia que se debe a la precaria disposicion del \"gobierno\" de manejar los casos de emergencia y al gran vacio del \"sistema de seguridad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn definitiva, ellos buscaron la salida de su grave crisis en imputar la responsabilidad a la RPDC inventando el \"rumor de ataque torpedero del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Responderemos con la represalia mas intensiva a la \"represalia\" y con el indiscriminado castigo a nuestro estilo al \"castigo\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora actua mas imprudentemente que nunca la camarilla de traidores surcoreanos que acabo de fraguar ese complot militar sin precedente en la historia de las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor primera vez en la historia, el traidor Lee Myung Bak aparecio en la llamada \"reunion de los comandantes importantes del ejercito\" y pronuncio acaloradamente esta frase tan conflictiva con la RPDC: \"manejaremos el asunto de modo claro y rotundo y no con palabras sino con acciones\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn sintonia con ello, los otros conservadores pertinaces como Kim Thae Yong, Ryu Myung Hwan y Hyon In Thaek andan ajetreados con su fiebre anti-RPDC coreando el \"castigo rotundo\" y el \"precio merecido\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su visita a varios paises como EE.UU., ellos imponen su mentira de que \"el Norte es el que hundio el ´Cheonan´\" y tratan de llevar el asunto al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU con la meta de tender el cerco de sancion internacional contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, tratan de reincluir a la RPDC en la \"lista de los paises que auspician el terrorismo\" y para este fin, hacen concesiones en los temas como el envio de sus tropas a Afganistan y la firma del \"Tratado de Libre Comercio\" con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las ordenes del traidor Lee Myung Bak, el circulo militar definio el dia de hundimiento como el \"dia de afrenta\" del ejercito y entro en la ejecucion del llamado \"plan de 50 dias para la victoria\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAparte de los sucesivos debates de guerra como la reunion arriba mencionada, quieren realizar en el Mar Oeste el marco-ejercicio conjunto contra submarinos con la presencia de un submarino nuclear de EE.UU. y reanudar en el contorno del frente la radioemision como parte de la guerra psicologica contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor conducto de las escorias repugnantes, hicieron un video sobre el \"hundimiento del Cheonan\" por el supuesto ataque torpedero del Norte, y mandaron divulgarlo ampliamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, hablan de la prohibicion de la navegacion de nuestras embarcaciones en el estrecho Jeju y de la ruptura total del intercambio y cooperacion economicos entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalifican de \"comunista e izquierdista\" y \"partidario del Norte\" a cualquier persona que no esta de acuerdo con el rumor de \"ataque torpedero del Norte\" y arrestan a los que expusieron las sospechas del \"resultado de investigacion\" amenazando con castigar duro a los que censuren el resultado o tomen parte en el \"mitin ilegal\" condenatorio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe atreven a reganar a los paises, que no se suman al complot, criticando que estan \"al lado del Norte\" o \"amparandolo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal extremado afan de confrontacion de los compinches surcoreanos no se puede pensar sin la instigacion de su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto estallo el incidente, EE.UU. insistio a gritos en que la RPDC esta vinculada con el incidente y estimula a sus titeres surcoreanos a la hostilidad y la confrontacion intransigentes con el Norte sosteniendo que es \"muy confiable\" el proceso de investigacion de los titeres y expresando el \"apoyo total\" a su resultado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tManifesto abiertamente su posicion de ofrecer la cooperacion necesaria, incluyendo en la politica, al publicar una declaracion despues del anuncio del resultado de investigacion de los titeres y apoyar la \"declaracion al pueblo\" del traidor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos connotados conspiradores de los Departamentos de Estado y de Defensa y de la CIA sostuvieron un debate y acordaron enviar el \"grupo de investigacion especial\" por conducto de la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas de la ONU\", que existe superficialmente, y gestionar el asunto por intermedio de la fantasmal \"Comision Militar de Armisticio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, perfeccionan la disposicion de agredir al Norte segun la estrategia de convertir la comandancia del octavo ejercito de EE.UU., estacionado en el Sur de Corea, en la \"ejecutora de guerra\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl complot de la camarilla de traidores surcoreanos en torno al buque \"Cheonan\" significa la negativa y rechazo totales a la epoca de reunificacion iniciada el 15 de Junio y un crimen supergrande que se registrara en la historia de las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea ya habian excluido hace mucho tiempo de la plantilla de los nacionales a esa camarilla que esta en agonia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl crimen se paga con el castigo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa imprudente campana conflictiva de la banda de Lee Myung Bak sirve solo para centuplicar la enemistad y el revanchismo del ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestros militares y civiles se mantienen en la disposicion de contraataque decisivo observando agudamente los movimientos de la camarilla surcoreana que acecha la oportunidad de aplastar a los connacionales vinculando el incidente con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los titeres surcoreanos incurren en el minimo movimiento provocativo en los planos politico, militar y economico confiando en el amparo de los imperialistas norteamericanos, la RPDC les respondera inmediatamente con la justa guerra para eliminar de la Peninsula Coreana a todas las escorias de la nacion y levantar en ella una Corea reunificada donde estara en prosperidad toda la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa estancia en el poder es momentanea y la nacion es eterna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras sea inquilina de Chongwadae (\"Casa Azul\") la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak, colmada de la hostilidad a la RPDC, no habra ninguna negociacion entre esta y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia y la verdad seran aclaradas tarde o temprano y los conspiradores seran condenados severamente por la justicia sin prescripcion."

Por esta razon, el nuevo sistema antimisiles sera otra bomba de tiempo en las relaciones entre Rusia y EE.UU."
