We should further consolidate, as firm as granite, the political and ideological unity and cohesion of the party and the revolutionary ranks on the basis of the great Songun idea and in the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the fundamental principle of strengthening the socialist political and ideological position in the Songun era to put primary efforts into increasing the political and ideological might of the People's Army and, on this basis, completely change the whole appearance of the society in a revolutionary way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity of the army and the people in ideology and in fighting and living morale is the most powerful means of consolidating our political and ideological position as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality in which we are standing in acute confrontation with the imperialist reactionaries makes it incumbent upon us to strengthen our socialist class position more solidly than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most essential in consolidating the socialist political and ideological position is to strengthen the party and uphold its leadership with all consistency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let all of us further consolidate our political and ideological position and give full play to its might under the great Songun revolutionary leadership of the headquarters of the revolution, thus glorifying this significant year as a year of proud victory unprecedented in the history of the country and the revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Wicked Remarks of Japanese Chief Executive under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- The Japanese chief executive at the recent G-8 summit uttered that Japan seeks a \"comprehensive solution to the issue of the abduction of Japanese and the nuclear issue\" and solicited \"understanding\" and \"cooperation\" from the participating nations as regards the abduction issue. He went the lengths of asserting that Japan \"would not normalize its relations with north Korea\" unless the abduction issue is solved.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everyone that his reckless remarks are intended to chill the atmosphere for the resumption of the six-party talks as they are nothing but an attempt to impair the image and authority of the DPRK and isolate it internationally, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is going to bring the abduction issue to the talks in a bid to kick up a racket there though they are slated to open soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBy nature, Japan is not qualified to take part in the six-party talks because Japan is the United States' faithful servant blindly following it without any principle. Japan's participation in the talks would only create complicity in their work, far from bringing anything helpful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent remarks of the Japanese chief executive made it clear that Japan is neither willing to liquidate its past nor interested in the resumption of the six-party talks, the settlement of the nuclear issue and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\r\n Japan's insincere, insolent and wicked behavior only touches off disillusionment with it among the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan keeps peddling the already solved abduction issue, going against the people's mind-set, it will have to pay a dear price for that.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
