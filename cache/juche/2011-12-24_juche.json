His gain of one victory after another is a shining review of Kim Jong Il's glorious history of Songun revolution, the editorial notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole life of Kim Jong Il was a brilliant life of the great Songun commander who began his revolutionary activities with arms and won one victory after another with the might of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The past two decades of his Songun revolution during which Kim Jong Il led the Korean revolution after assuming the heavy responsibility as the supreme commander of the KPA was the period recorded with heroic feats as he won the most shining victory in the nation's history in the crucible of the most arduous struggle. It is brilliantly adorned as two decades of great succession in which he firmly defended President Kim Il Sung's ideas and exploits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to his Songun leadership that the history of victory which started in the forest of Mt. Paektu under the leadership of the President could be given steady continuity generation after generation and an eternal foundation could be laid for a rosy future of Kim Il Sung's Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il was the most illustrious commander who built the People's Army into an invincible army remaining most loyal to the ideas and cause of the President as a successor to the Songun tradition of Mt. Paektu. He was an invincible and iron-willed commander who provided an eternal foundation on which all the servicepersons and people could firmly defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and the socialist cause under any circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il was the great leader who provided a sure guarantee for steadily carrying forward the cause of the Juche-oriented revolutionary cause, the cause of Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He implanted profound truth about arms into the mind of respected Kim Jong Un and helped him prize it already long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un is the Mt. Paektu-style great man who acquired qualifications and personality as the leader of Songun revolution on the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our country and the Korean revolution have a rosy future as they are led by Kim Jong Un possessed of intense loyalty and the noble sense of moral obligation towards the leader, extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom, matchless courage and outstanding leadership art."
