Feasting his eyes on modern houses and cozy, neat and tidy cultural and welfare facilities, he said that the more one sees the village, the more beautiful it looks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That day he met with heads of work teams and sub-work teams who distinguished themselves in grain production and gave a warm pep talk to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Wherever one goes in co-op fields, one can find many ardent patriots who have single-mindedly upheld the party with agricultural production, he said, stressing that the best socialist rural economy system in the DPRK is growing stronger as the days go by as such dependable and true revolutionaries in the rural areas are working hard at the agricultural posts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced important tasks facing the farm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that a solid foundation for drastically increasing the agricultural production was laid thanks to the strenuous efforts made by people in different parts of the country for rural construction in recent years weathering manifold difficulties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These shining successes provide a sure guarantee for finally solving the issues of agriculture, farmer and the countryside in our country and opening the gate to a thriving nation with dignity, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, now brisk in the countryside and intensified assistance to the countryside and more effective state guidance to the cooperative farms promoted the drive to assimilate the farmers to the working class, industrialize the agriculture and face-lift the countryside, thus remarkably narrowing the distinction between the urban and rural areas, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a striking demonstration of the validity and great vitality of the socialist rural theses put forward by the President and the advantageous socialist rural economy system of the country, he noted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the agricultural front is the major front in the struggle to improve the people's standard of living, he called upon the whole country and all the people to continue focusing all efforts on farming in order to bring about a decisive turn in the agricultural production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the farm would creditably perform pioneer's role in implementing the WPK's agriculture-first policy this year, too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, chief secretary of the North Hwanghae Provincial Committee of the WPK, Department Directors Kim Kyong Hui and Jang Song Thaek and First Vice Department Directors Ri Je Gang and Ri Jae Il of the Central Committee of the WPK."

It built secret prisons in different parts of the world, mercilessly killing innocent people and forcing humiliation and disgrace upon them. The brigandish \"war on terrorism\" launched by it is an unprecedented war to deprive other countries of their national sovereignty and a horrible war to abuse human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international arena dealing with human rights should naturally force the above-said war criminals and worst human rights abusers to stand trial and face a stern punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop the political charade and mind its own business as it may cause the above-said council to meet the same miserable end as that of the committee."

The Korean schools in Japan are legitimate national education institutions under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), a dignified overseas citizens' organization of the DPRK. Therefore, they have an equal right to education with Japanese schools and it is natural for the Japanese government to ensure them the right to education. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The students who are studying at the Korean schools in Japan are the descendants of those Koreans who were forcibly taken to Japan by the Japanese imperialists in the past.
