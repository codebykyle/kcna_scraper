            "content": "KCNA Denounces Japan's Distortion of History \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency issued memorandum titled \"We Denounce Japan's Despicable Distortion of History\" on May 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sheer distortion of the crime-woven past history has become all the more pronounced in Japan of late. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history textbooks for middle school students which the Japanese authorities screened and approved seriously distort the acts of aggression committed by Japan against Korea for centuries and its military occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The textbooks ambiguously describe Japan's invasion of Korea in 1592 as \"the dispatch of its troops to Korea,\" thus whitewashing its aggression. They justify the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea by asserting that their military occupation and rule \"helped Korea in modernization\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The textbooks do not mention anti-Japanese volunteers' struggle, massacre of fighters for independence, the March First Popular Uprising in 1919, the June 10 independence movement in 1926, the punitive campaign in 1920 and the massacre of Koreans during Kanto quake in 1923. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aso, who was chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan in 2003, blustered that the Koreans' requests for Japanese names kicked off Koreans' change of their names into Japanese and that the Korean alphabets were taught by Japanese and it would be better to have correct understanding of historical facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nakayama, who was minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in 2005, asserted that students should be taught that Tok Islet is part of Japan's territory, claiming that what is essential in education is to teach students what does belong to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revised version of the textbook which was released by the Society for History Textbook Reform in 2005 beautified the Sino-Japanese, Russo-Japanese and the Pacific wars as wars for self-defence and wars for liberation and described Japan as the worst Pacific War victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the government instructed the relevant institutions to describe Tok Islet as part of Japan's territory in textbooks for high schools to be used from 2007. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to tamper with its history date back to the mid 1950s when it concealed or downplayed its crimes. It has since systematically committed sheer distortion and denial of its wrongs while beautifying and exaggerating what it did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is Japan's total denial of the crimes related to the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denial of those crimes has become all the more undisguised since the emergence of the Abe regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prime Minister Abe, when interviewed by reporters on March 1 this year, said that there is no evidence proving that Japan coercively recruited women to provide sex for the Imperial Japanese Army. He, addressing the meeting of the House of Councilors Budgetary Committee on March 5, said that Japan would never apologize even in case of the carriage of a resolution urging the Japanese government to make apology for the sexual slavery already presented to U.S. Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign Minister Aso, speaking at the meeting of the House of Representatives Budgetary Committee in February, expressed his displeasure with the submission of a resolution calling for the Japanese government's frank apology for the issue of \"comfort women\" to the U.S. House of Representatives, saying that it is not based on objective facts at all and it is very regrettable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Shimomura on March 25 uttered that there were military nurses and war correspondents but no \"comfort women\", adding that the Japanese military was not involved in the issue of sexual servitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan described as wrong the statement made by the then Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono in 1993 in which he admitted, apologized and repented of the crimes related to the \"comfort women,\" asserting that there was something ambiguous and it caused misunderstanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The League of Dietmen Thinking of the Future of Japan and History Education concluded that there was no such coercive recruitment of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army and requested the authorities to adopt it as an official view of the government. It went the lengths of declaring that it would reexamine Kono's statement dealing with the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On March 16 the government in what it called a written reply adopted at a Cabinet session claimed that the materials discovered by the government contained no evidence proving that women were coercively recruited by the Japanese army or police for sexual slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sankei Shimbun joined in the authorities' campaign to tamper with history, by carrying in its April 8th issue an article which claimed that there were cases in which the Japanese military was directly involved in the examination of sexually transmitted diseases at \"comfort stations\" but not in such coercive recruitment of women as slave-hunting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the crime-woven history can never be covered up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was hard facts that the Japanese imperialists took women from several countries and forced them to provide sex at battle fields during the war of aggression by use of government and military power. More facts about these monstrous crimes are being probed one after another by testimonies made by victims and witnesses, documents worked out at those times and confessions made by ex-servicemen of the Imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hirofumi Hayashi, professor at Kanto Gakuin University, Japan, at a press conference held by the Association of Foreign Correspondents on April 17 this year disclosed seven more materials related to the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These materials proved that quite many files of documents have been worked out and presented to disclose horrendous crimes committed in the regions occupied by the Japanese army thanks to the efforts exerted by prosecution authorities of various countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koyama and Sakakura, ex-soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army, admitted sexual slavery at a press conference on April 26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They confessed that there were \"comfort stations\" at every unit they belonged to, adding that the operation of such stations was impossible without the military's order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A confidential document of the Dutch government testifying to the coercive recruitment of \"comfort women\" by the Imperial Japanese Army was recently declassified. The contents of the document which a Dutch officer sent to his country when he was in Indonesia right after the end of the Second World War proved that the Imperial Japanese Army deeply involved itself in the \"comfort women\" issue ranging from their coercive recruitment to the operation of the \"comfort stations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's distortion of history is a serious criminal act to shirk off the responsibility for redeeming its past crimes and put spurs to the process of making the Japanese society turn reactionary in terms of ideology and mentality in a bid to repeat its history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is called upon to heighten vigilance against the Japanese reactionaries' moves to distort history as they work hard to keep buried into oblivion the wars of aggression, massacres and the monstrous group rape perpetrated by Japan in the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's persistent distortion of history will leave another shameful blot on the human history in the 21st century and then it will never escape international isolation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

\"En repudio a las sucias maniobras de Japon encaminadas a la tergiversacion de la historia\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Su texto resumido va como sigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En estos tiempos, en Japon se cometen expresamente las acciones antihistoricas orientadas a dar negativa al ensangrentado expediente criminal de este pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los manuales de historia para las escuelas secundarias, examinados y aprobados por las autoridades japonesas, distorsionan de gravedad la agresion y la ocupacion militar a Corea por Japon, que se produjeron durante varios siglos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En particular, estos libros anotan el inicio de la \"guerra Imjin desatada por Japon\" como la \"marcha a Corea\" para camuflar la agresion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Igualmente, abogan por las \"conveniencias\" del colonialismo a Corea al apuntar que la ocupacion militar a esta por parte de los imperialistas japoneses \"contribuyo a la modernizacion de ella\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, no se refieren a la matanza a las tropas voluntarias antijaponesas y otros independentistas y a los genocidios de los coreanos escenificados durante el Levantamiento Popular del Primero de Marzo de 1919, la manifestacion del 10 de junio de 1926, la \"gran operacion punitiva del ano Kyongsin (1920)\" y el gran terremoto de Kanto, Japon, ocurrido en 1923. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por otra parte, Aso peroro en 2003, cuando fungia como presidente del comite de averiguacion de asuntos politicos del Partido Democratico Liberal de Japon, que \"el cambio de nombres y apellidos de los coreanos al estilo japones comenzo cuando estos pidieron que los bautizaran\" y \"las letras coreanas fueron ensenadas por los japoneses y seria mejor tener correcta compresion de los hechos historicos\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En 2005, el ministro de Educacion, Cultura, Deporte, Ciencia y Tecnologia, Nakayama, dijo que deben instruir a los alumnos que la isla Tok es \"parte del territorio japones\" tras subrayar que lo clave en la ensenanza es educar la posicion territorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El libro reeditado el mismo ano por el \"encuentro para la redaccion del nuevo manual de historia\" califico la guerra China-Japon, la Rusia-Japon, la del Pacifico de \"guerras para la autodefensa y liberacion\" y mintio como si el pais isleno fuera el \"mas perjudicado\" en la ultima contienda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Recientemente, el gobierno japones ordeno anotar la isla Tok como \"territorio japones\" en los manuales de historia para escuelas superiores que iban a entrar en uso desde el ano en curso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las maniobras de distorsion de la historia comenzaron a mediados de la decada de 1950 por el encubrimiento y disminucion de los crimenes y ahora se extendieron a la tergiversacion total, negacion y elogio a los mismos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo mas grave del caso es la negativa total al arresto forzado a las \"consoladoras sexuales\" para el viejo ejercito nipon, que se torno mas porfiada y brutal en el gabinete de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En una rueda de prensa concedida el primero de marzo del ano en curso, el premier Abe asevero que no hay pruebas para confirmar lo forzado del reclutamiento de aquellas mujeres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, el dia 5 del mismo mes, juro ante la comision presupuestaria de la camara de consejeros de la dieta que no pediria perdon jamas aunque sea aprobado en el congreso norteamericano el proyecto de resolucion en demanda de la excusa del gobierno japones por ese crimen de esclavitud sexual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Mientras tanto, el canciller Aso expreso en febrero en la comision presupuestaria de la camara de representantes su descontento por el sometimiento de ese proyecto de resolucion en el mismo organo legislativo de EE.UU. al decir que \"es muy lamentable que este documento no se basara en nada en los hechos objetivos\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El 25 de marzo, el subdirector del secretariado del gabinete japones, Simomura, trato de desvincular al viejo ejercito japones de este asunto al mentir que no hubo \"consoladoras sexuales\" si bien operaban las enfermeras y corresponsales de guerra mientras el presidente del comite de averiguacion de asuntos politicos del Partido Democratico Liberal tildo de \"ambigua y productora de confusiones\" la declaracion de 1993 del ex director del secretariado del gabinete Kono, que habia reconocido ese crimen y pedido excusas y reflexiones por el respecto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En tanto, el \"encuentro de los parlamentarios pensativos en el futuro de Japon y la educacion de historia\" saco la conclusion de que no hubo el arresto forzado a las \"consoladoras\" para el viejo ejercito nipon y demando a las autoridades que la oficializaran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, procedio a \"reexaminar\" esa \"declaracion\" de Kono. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El 16 de marzo, en una llamada respuesta aprobada en una reunion del gabinete, el gobierno nipon anuncio que en los datos hallados por si mismo no hay pruebas alusivas al arresto forzado de esas feminas por parte del ejercito o de la policia de su pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Mientras tanto, se unio a tal procedimiento de las autoridades el rotativo \"Sankei Shimbun\" al reportar en su edicion del 8 de abril que las tropas japonesas no participaron directamente en el arresto forzado de las \"consoladoras sexuales\", igual a la caza de esclavos, aunque habian metido la mano en el examen venereo llevado a cabo en las \"casas de cita con ellas\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero es imposible encubrir la historia criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las declaraciones de las propias victimas y testigos, los documentos de aquel entonces y las confesiones de los uniformados del viejo ejercito japones esclarecen que los imperialistas del pais isleno impusieron la inhumana vida de esclava sexual a las mujeres de varios paises llevandoselas a los campos de guerra de agresion a fuerza de las autoridades gubernamentales y militares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En conferencia de prensa concedida el 17 de abril de este ano en la asociacion de corresponsales extranjeros, el profesor de la Universidad Kanto Gakuin, Hirofumi Hayashi, dio a la publicidad 7 nuevos datos relacionados con el mismo caso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Segun ellos, gracias a los esfuerzos de las autoridades fiscales de varios paises, se prepara y se presenta una fabulosa cantidad de documentos que prueban las atrocidades cometidas en los territorios ocupados por el viejo ejercito japones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En tanto, los ex uniformados Koyama y Sakakura admitieron en una rueda de prensa del 26 de abril los hechos criminales del abuso sexual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Precisaron que en todas las unidades donde ellos mismos fueron ubicados operaban las \"casas de cita\" y confesaron que el establecimiento de las mismas resultaba imposible sin las ordenes de la cupula militar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hace poco, quedo descifrado un documento secreto del gobierno holandes que confirma el caracter forzado del reclutamiento de esas victimas de abuso sexual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los detalles de un documento, que fue parte a su pais de un oficial holandes enviado a Indonesia inmediatamente despues del fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, corrobora la participacion entera de las tropas japonesas en todo el proceso criminal, o sea, desde el reclutamiento forzado hasta la operacion de las \"casas de cita\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tales maniobras para distorsionar la historia se encaminan a evadir la responsabilidad por la liquidacion del pasado criminal y reeditar la historia de agresion al fomentar la conversion de Japon en una sociedad reaccionaria ideo-espiritual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todo el mundo debe estar muy alerto ante esa conducta de los reaccionarios japoneses quienes tratan de dejar en el olvido de la historia los crimenes de su pais que mancharon el siglo XX con las guerras de agresion, genocidios y la violacion sexual colectiva de mayor magnitud. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si el pais isleno no se deja de esas asquerosas maniobras, volvera a registrar los vergonzosos crimenes en la historia de la humanidad del siglo 21 y quedara aislado para siempre en el escenario internacional.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
