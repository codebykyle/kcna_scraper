It also fully reveals the arrogance and the shamelessness of the U.S. going reckless in utter disregard of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He emphasized that the Committee is obliged to hold the U.S. authorities liable for the recent incident of grave severity and consequences, and urged the U.S. to return the package immediately and unconditionally. He also called for practical steps so that there would not be any more violation of sovereignty of the UN member nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Cyprian mission at the U.N., chair of the Committee, and many other missions represented at the session including those from China, Russia, Cuba, Iran and Syria, denounced the U.S. extortion of the DPRK's diplomatic package as a serious and never-to-be-condoned act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They urged the U.S. to make an official apology for encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and return the package immediately as demanded by the DPRK side. And they stressed that the U.S. should respect the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, ensure the personal safety of all the delegations visiting the U.S. to take part in the UN conferences and respect the inviolable right of diplomatic packages."
