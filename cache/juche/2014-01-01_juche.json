            "content": "Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's New Year Address\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, made a New Year address on January 1, 2014. The following is its full text:\n\t\t\t\t\t Dear comrades, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dear service personnel of the Korean People's Army, all the people and other compatriots,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having seen out 2013, a year in which we left a remarkable footprint on the road of the sacred march of the Juche revolution, we are seeing in the new year 2014 filled with confidence in the future and revolutionary self-respect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reflecting the boundless yearning and high respect of all the service personnel and people for the great President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il, I would like first to pay the highest tribute and New Year greetings to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I extend tribute also to the martyrs who dedicated their precious lives to national defence and socialist construction last year and New Year greetings to all the service personnel and people who are opening a new era of the country's prosperity following the leadership of our Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And greeting the new year I wish that the families across the country would overflow with greater happiness and joy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t My New Year greetings go also to my compatriots in the south, who are fighting for independence, democracy and national reunification, to my compatriots abroad, who are devoting their all to the prosperity of their motherland, and to the progressive peoples of the world and other foreign friends, who love justice and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year was a proud year in which the entire Party, the whole army and all the people waged an all-out offensive in support of the Party's new line of developing the two fronts simultaneously and thus achieved brilliant successes in building a thriving socialist country and defending socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year our service personnel and people, firmly rallied behind the Party, exalted the brilliance of the ideas and cause of the President and the General and strengthened the political and ideological might of our revolutionary ranks all the more.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the political events held in celebration of the 65th anniversary of the founding of the DPRK and the 60th anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War and in the whole course of last year's struggle, they demonstrated their firm faith and will in holding the President and the General in high esteem and carrying forward their imperishable exploits to posterity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party's policies of respecting the people and loving them and the people's hearty loyalty of trusting and following the Party as they would do their mothers have become integrated, and thus the blood-sealed ties between them have reached a new, higher stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the seething period of the effort for building a thriving country last year we took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists lurking in the Party. As our Party detected and purged the anti-Party, counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision, the Party and revolutionary ranks were further consolidated and our single-hearted unity was solidified to the maximum. Through this struggle our Party affirmed that as a party that serves the people, it will fully discharge the honourable mission it has assumed for the times and history and devote its all to the good of the people by enhancing its militant functions and role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year we consolidated our capabilities for self-defence and achieved a brilliant victory in the acute showdown with the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The scientists, technicians and workers in the sector of defence industry, by going beyond the cutting edge of military science with steadfast faith and mettle, demonstrated the strength of Songun Korea and rendered great services to consolidating the national defence capabilities. The officers and men of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, cherishing the spirit of defending their leader and motherland unto death, defended their Party and leader, country and people at the risk of their lives and smashed the reckless moves of the enemy for igniting a nuclear war and their rackets of confrontation with the DPRK at every step, thus highly exalting the dignity and might of their country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the circumstances were harsh and complicated last year, our service personnel and people, by pooling their efforts, achieved great successes in the struggle to build their country into an economic giant and improve the people's standard of living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An upsurge was brought about in production in several sectors and units of the national economy, and the foundations of the self-supporting economy were further consolidated. The officials and working people in the agricultural sector in particular made innovations in production even under difficult conditions and unfavourable natural climate and thus contributed to improving the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and other builders set up numerous monumental structures for the prosperity of their country and well-being of their fellow people and ushered in a heyday of construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHaving turned out in response to the Party's appeal to create the \"Masikryong speed,\" they carried out many construction projects, like the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, Unha Scientists Street, Munsu Water Park and Masikryong Ski Resort, in a short period as befitting the creations in the era of the Workers' Party by displaying burning patriotic enthusiasm and working with devotion. In this way, they showed their country's proud appearance, which is changing with each passing day, and ensured that the people's laughter of happiness could ring out louder. Those who turned out for the reclamation of the Sepho Plateau and other large-scale construction projects tamed nature, overcoming difficulties, thereby opening a breakthrough in realizing the Party's far-reaching plan at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Also, the sector of culture, including sports and education, made fresh strides last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t True to the Party's intention of building our country into a sports power, a strong wind of conducting sports swept the country, and our trustworthy sportspeople won gold medals in international competitions and thus highly exalted the honour of their motherland.   Preparations for enforcing a universal 12-year compulsory education were successfully promoted, many achievements made in the sector of science and technology, and up-to-date medical facilities introduced for the improvement of medical services for the people.   The sector of musical art created many famous works of our times, inspiring loyalty in all the service personnel and people and encouraging them to wage a dynamic struggle and perform great feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shining victories and successes we achieved last year can be ascribed to the fact that the entire Party, the whole army and all the people, in support of the revolutionary and people-oriented lines and policies of our Party and its wise leadership, waged a heroic struggle with an indomitable faith and will to build a thriving socialist country without fail. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through last year's struggle we clearly demonstrated that our ideology, our strength and our way are the best and no force can check our sacred cause advancing to accomplish a far-reaching ideal and goal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I extend heartfelt thanks to all the service personnel and people, who adorned the meaningful year 2013 with eye-opening successes by displaying boundless loyalty to the Party, warm affection for their country and unparalleled self-sacrificing spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new year 2014 will be a year of grandiose struggle, a year of sea changes, in which we will raise a fierce wind of making a fresh leap forward on all fronts of building a thriving socialist country and thus usher in a golden age of Songun Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our struggle of this year is a worthwhile struggle to translate the people's beautiful ideals and dreams into reality at an early date and a victors' march leading to the venue of grand festival for celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this hope-filled year we should usher in a great heyday in the revolution and construction by quickening the heroic march with enthusiasm and confidence in victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Let us raise a fierce wind of making a fresh leap forward on all fronts of building a thriving country filled with confidence in victory!\" -- this is the militant slogan our Party and people should uphold this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year we should ensure that the sectors of agriculture, construction and science and technology hold the torch of innovations in the van and the flames of the torch flare up as flames of a leap forward on all the fronts of socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year is a meaningful one that marks the 50th anniversary of the theses on socialist rural question made public by President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should clearly prove the validity and vitality of the theses by waging the ideological, technological and cultural revolutions dynamically in the rural areas and bringing about a decisive turn in agricultural production. This year we should keep up agriculture as a major thrust of our effort in the struggle for economic construction and improving the people's standard of living, and concentrate all our efforts on farming. The agricultural sector should proactively introduce scientific farming methods and do farm work in a responsible manner so as to hit without fail the target of agricultural production set by the Party. It should improve animal husbandry and do greenhouse vegetable and mushroom farming on an extensive scale so as to ensure that larger quantities of meat, vegetables and mushrooms are supplied to the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should usher in a new heyday of construction this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Construction is an important front for solidifying the foundations of a thriving country and creating bases for the people's happy life. The construction sector should set up world-class structures representative of the Songun era and build many other structures that could contribute to improving the people's living conditions, thus laying firm foundations of the self-supporting economy and providing the people with conditions for a more affluent and civilized life. Construction of power stations in tiers on the Chongchon River, livestock farming bases in the Sepho area, the Kosan Fruit Farm and a waterway in South Hwanghae Province and reclamation of tidal flats and other major projects should be stepped up to be completed on schedule. It is important to push ahead with the construction of dwelling houses and dormitories and construction for improving the conditions and environment for education, and set up cultural and welfare service bases on the highest standard. This ye\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t ar, too, the service personnel and people should make concerted efforts to build up Pyongyang so that it is more grandiose, and lay out the provinces, cities and counties so that they sustain their respective local features.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Science and technology are a propellant for building a thriving country, and the happiness of the people and the future of the country hinge on their development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The scientific research sector should open a shortcut to the building of a knowledge-based economy by solving the long-term problems in developing the country's economy and improving the people's standard of living as well as scientific and technological problems arising in the actual situation and by going beyond the cutting edge.  All scientists and technicians should achieve high results by skilfully riding the excellent \"steed\" provided to them by the Party and giving fullest scope to their talents and enthusiasm. By doing so, they can become true patriots who contribute to building a thriving nation. A climate of attaching importance to science and technology should prevail across society, and all officials and working people should diligently learn modern science and technology upholding the slogan of making all the people well versed in science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should raise fierce flames of innovations in the vanguard sectors, basic industrial sectors, and all other sectors of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The metallurgical and chemical industries are twin buttresses of an economic giant. Developing these industries is a major guarantee for economic construction and improving the people's standard of living.  These industrial sectors should hold high the slogan of making them Juche-oriented and modern and launch a vigorous campaign for boosting production by relying on our own raw materials and fuels and on the latest science and technology. In this way they should supply sufficient amounts of steel and various kinds of chemical goods that are needed to reenergize the national economy as a whole and improve the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should give definite priority to electric-power and coal-mining industries. While taking measures for generating electricity to the maximum at the existing power stations, we should draw up correct prospective plans for radically easing the strain on electricity supply and exert ourselves to carry them out. It is important to produce more electricity with priority given to hydraulic resources and by using wind, geothermal, solar and other kinds of natural energy. We should proactively increase production in coal mines and drastically solve the problem of rail and other types of transport. The electric-power and coal-mining industries and the rail transport sector should make coordinated innovations and thus give strong impetus to the development of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should direct great efforts to developing light industry which plays a major part in improving the people's standard of living. By stepping up modernization of and introduction of CNC technology into their production lines and increasing the proportion of locally-available raw and other materials, light-industry factories should put production on a normal footing. And all cities and counties should produce various kinds of quality consumer goods in larger amounts by developing local industry in conformity with their specific conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The state should take measures to bolster up the fishing sector. The sector should follow the example of the fishing sector of the People's Army that landed a huge haul of fishes by carrying out the order of the Supreme Commander unto death. By modernizing fishing vessels and implements and launching a dynamic fishing campaign by scientific methods, it should ensure that all ports resound with whistles of vessels returning with full loads. It should also conduct shallow-sea farming on an extensive scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should protect and increase the country's priceless natural resources including underground, forest and marine resources, and conduct an energetic mass-based tree-planting drive to cover all the mountains with thick forests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the sectors of the national economy should increase production by tapping all potentials and latent reserves, and at the same time launch a brisk economization campaign. Economizing is precisely production and a manifestation of patriotism. We should intensify the economization campaign throughout society so as to make economical use of every watt of electricity, every gramme of coal and every drop of water. All the people should establish a habit of meticulously managing the country's economy with a high sense of patriotism and attitude as befitting masters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should decisively improve the guidance and management of the economy. We should tighten the unified guidance of the economy by the state under the leadership of the Party, enhance the sense of responsibility and creativity of enterprises and encourage all the working people to discharge their responsibility and role as masters of production and management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should make a big stride in the construction of culture, including education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of education should improve the contents, methods, conditions and environment of education as required by the revolution and developing times and bring about a fresh turn in education, including secondary general education. By putting efforts to medical treatment and preventive medicine for promoting the people's health, the public health sector should ensure that the benefits of socialist healthcare system reach the people more closely.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tArt and literature are a bugler, a powerful propellant, for the revolutionary advance in building a thriving country. The sector of art and literature should produce large numbers of masterpieces of the times, which are high in ideological and artistic qualities and touch the heartstrings of the audience keeping step with the advance of our revolution and vibrant realities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should raise more fiercely the strong wind of conducting sports throughout the country. We should encourage sportspeople to intensify training with a high ambition to become world champions, and splendidly implement the Party's plan of building our country into a sports power by developing sports science and technology and implementing the policy of making sports mass-based.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should continue to channel great efforts into building up the country's defence capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strengthening defence capabilities is the most important of all state affairs, and the country's dignity, people's happiness and peace rest on powerful arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should further develop the People's Army into the powerful revolutionary army of Paektusan that is unfailingly faithful to the Party, the leader, the country and the people. The main link in the whole chain of developing the People's Army is strengthening the company which is the basic combat unit of the army and base of soldiers' life. We should make all the companies elite combat ranks fully prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and technologically and their dear homes overflowing with brotherly affection. By stepping up political and ideological education among service personnel, we should train them to be strong in ideology and faith and ready to defend the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun and the Party Central Committee unto death. They should intensify combat training and launch a brisk movement for becoming crackshots so as to prepare themselves to be a-match-for-a-hundred combatants with excellent marksmanship, strong physique and a high sense of discipline\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Internal Security Forces should creditably discharge its noble mission and duty of defending the leader, system and people by thoroughly establishing the Party's command system and revolutionary military climate in it, and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards should intensify combat training and remain fully ready for action at all times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of defence industry should manufacture larger numbers of modern military hardware of our own style that are light, unmanned, intelligent and of high precision to solidify the self-defence capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should further consolidate the political and ideological position of our revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political and ideological position is a fortress that decides the victory and failure in the battle of defending socialism, and consolidating the revolutionary ranks politically and ideologically is the most important task facing us.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this significant year, in which we greet the 40th anniversary of the programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism advanced by the great General, we should solidify the Party organizationally and ideologically, train all the members of society to be equipped with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and cement the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is imperative to establish the monolithic leadership system in the Party, definitely ensure the purity of Party ranks and improve the militant functions and role of Party organizations. We should intensify ideological education among officials, Party members and other working people to ensure that they think and act at all times and in all places in line with the Party's ideas and intentions with the steadfast faith that they know only the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and our Party. We should ensure that they approach with political awareness even the slightest phenomenon and element that infringe on the unity of the Party and revolutionary ranks and undermine their single-hearted unity, and eliminate them in a thoroughgoing way. They should wage a vigorous struggle to stamp out any sort of alien ideology and decadent lifestyle which may undermine our system and thus resolutely smash the enemy's schemes for ideological and cultural infiltration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to make the flames of a leap forward flare up on all fronts of building a thriving socialist country, it is crucial to give fullest play to the mental strength of the masses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The greatest potential for creation and innovation, the fundamental key to miraculous change, lies in giving play to the mental strength of all the service personnel and people. A sweeping ideological campaign for information and motivational purposes should be undertaken to give free rein to the mental strength of Party members and other working people. All of them should make Kim Jong Il's patriotism part of their mental qualities and apply it in practice, and thus become performers of heroic feats in the worthwhile struggle to build theirs into a socialist country, powerful and civilized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to establish stringent revolutionary discipline and order in all domains of the revolutionary struggle and construction work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an important factor in demonstrating the advantages of collectivism of our society and making a success of all undertakings.   All sectors and all units should carry out to the letter the policies of the Party and the laws, decisions and directives of the state, and encourage the officials and working people alike to observe laws, regulations and order with full awareness of being masters of our society and citizens of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials should make redoubled efforts to fulfil their duty as leading members of the revolution and faithful servants of the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should organize undertakings in a big way with absolute loyalty to the Party, a high sense of responsibility for their work and fervent zeal, and strive with unflinching perseverance to implement the Party's plans and intentions without fail. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should regard the people's demands and interests as the absolute criteria for their performance, concern themselves only about doing things as wished by them and to their liking, and do anything in a way beneficial to them. They should be deeply sincere to people's demands and opinions, and live and work as their true servants who devote themselves to their interests at all times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year marks the 20th anniversary of the date when President Kim Il Sung wrote his last signature on a historic document concerning the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t True to the behests of President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il, we should make fresh headway in the national reunification movement for this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To resolve the reunification issue in keeping with the aspirations and desires of our fellow countrymen, we should reject foreign forces and hold fast to the standpoint of By Our Nation Itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The driving force for national reunification is all the members of the Korean nation in the north, in the south and abroad; only when we remain steadfast in this standpoint can we reunify the country independently in line with our nation's interests and demands. To go on a tour around foreign countries touting for \"international cooperation\" in resolving the inter-Korean relations issue, the one related with our nation, is a humiliating treachery of leaving its destiny in the hands of outside forces. The north and the south should uphold the principle of independence which is one of the three principles for national reunification and has been confirmed in the north-south joint declarations, hold fast to the standpoint of By Our Nation Itself, and respect and implement the declarations with sincerity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should make positive efforts to defend national security and peace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The US and south Korean war maniacs have deployed legions of equipment for a nuclear war in and around the Korean peninsula and are going frantic in their military exercises for a nuclear war against the north; this precipitates a critical situation where any accidental military skirmish may lead to an all-out war. Should another war break out on this land, it will result in a deadly nuclear catastrophe and the United States will never be safe. All the Korean people must not tolerate the manoeuvres for war and confrontation by the bellicose forces at home and abroad but stoutly resist and frustrate them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A favourable climate should be established for improved relations between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is heartrending to see our nation partitioned by foreign forces, and it is more intolerable to see one side slinging mud at and showing hostility to the other. This will serve merely as an occasion for the forces who are undesirous of seeing one Korea to fish in troubled waters. It is high time to put an end to such slander and calumny that bring no good to both sides, and they should desist from doing anything detrimental to national unity and reconciliation. The south Korean authorities should discontinue the reckless confrontation with their compatriots and the racket against the \"followers of the north,\" and choose to promote inter-Korean relations in response to the call of the nation for independence, democracy and national reunification. We will join hands with anyone who opts to give priority to the nation and wishes for its reunification, regardless of his or her past, and continue to strive for better inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Korean people in the north, in the south and abroad should achieve solid unity under the truly patriotic banner, the principle of  By Our Nation Itself, and turn out in the nationwide struggle for the reunification of the country. By doing so, they should open up a new phase for independent reunification, peace and prosperity this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year, in the international arena, the imperialists persisted in interference and war moves threatening the independence of other sovereign states and the right of mankind to existence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Especially the Korean peninsula, the hottest spot in the world, was in a hair-trigger situation due to the hostile forces' manoeuvres for a nuclear war against the DPRK, which posed a serious threat to peace and security in the region and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more precious for our people than peace, but it is not something that can be achieved if we simply crave and beg for it. We can never just sit back with folded arms and see the dark clouds of a nuclear war against us hovering over the Korean peninsula. We will defend our country's sovereignty, peace and dignity by relying on our powerful self-defensive strength. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Holding fast to the ideals of our foreign policy -- independence, peace and friendship -- our Party and the government of the DPRK will, in the future, too, strive to expand and develop relations of friendship and cooperation with all the countries that respect our sovereignty and are friendly to us, and safeguard global peace and security and promote common prosperity of mankind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe tasks facing us are gigantic and difficulties stand in our way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, our revolutionary cause is sure to emerge victorious as we advance under the great banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let all of us strive for greater victory in the new year, filled with high ambition and unwavering confidence and firmly united behind the Party with a single heart."

En ese sector introduciran de modo activo los cientificos metodos de cultivo y trabajaran con toda responsabilidad hasta conquistar a toda costa la meta de produccion de cereales presentada por el Partido. Promoveran la ganaderia y ampliaran el cultivo de hongos y de verduras en invernaderos para que la poblacion se beneficie de la mayor cantidad posible de sus productos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano debemos abrir una nueva era de prosperidad en la construccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa construccion es un renglon importante para consolidar la base del Estado poderoso y prospero y crear el cimiento para la felicidad del pueblo. A la rama de construccion le incumbe levantar muchos edificios de categoria mundial que representen la era del Songun y obras destinadas a mejorar la vida de los habitantes, para asi consolidar la base de nuestra economia independiente y procurarle al pueblo una vida mas rica y civilizada. Hay que acelerar y terminar en la fecha prevista las obras importantes como la construccion escalonada de centrales hidroelectricas a lo largo del rio Chongchon, la base ganadera en la zona de Sepho, la Granja de Frutas de Kosan, la roturacion de marismas y los canales de riego para la provincia de Hwanghae del Sur.

Este ano debemos seguir levantando majestuosas y elegantes construcciones en la ciudad de Pyongyang y resaltar la peculiaridad de cada provincia, ciudad y distrito, mediante la cooperacion de militares y civiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas ciencias y la tecnologia son la fuerza motriz que impulsa la edificacion de un Estado poderoso y prospero y de su desarrollo dependen la felicidad del pueblo y el porvenir de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse sector debe resolver problemas para el futuro desarrollo de la economia nacional y el mejoramiento de la vida del pueblo y los que se presentan en la actualidad, superar a los demas en la tecnologia de punta y abrir un atajo para la estructuracion de la economia de conocimientos. Los cientificos y tecnicos, montados sobre el caballo alado que les ha regalado el Partido y valiendose de todo el talento y entusiasmo, deben lograr grandes exitos en su trabajo y ser genuinos patriotas que contribuyen a la edificacion de una patria rica y poderosa. En toda la sociedad concederan prioridad a las ciencias y la tecnologia, en tanto que todos los funcionarios y trabajadores las aprenderan con aplicacion, enarbolando la consigna que los convoca a ser talentosos cientificos y tecnicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso hacer grandes innovaciones en el sector priorizado, las industrias basicas, y las demas esferas de la economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl renglon metalurgico y el quimico son pilares gemelos de la potencia economica y su desarrollo asegura la construccion economica y el mejoramiento de la vida de la poblacion. En estas ramas debemos esforzarnos con teson para aumentar la produccion recurriendo a nuestras materias primas, combustible y ultimos logros cientificos, en acato a la consigna de modernizar la economia y adecuarla a nuestra realidad, con el fin de activar el conjunto de la economia nacional y producir suficiente cantidad de materiales de hierro y acero y diversos articulos quimicos necesarios para el fomento de la vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que priorizar decididamente las industrias electrica y carbonifera. Al tiempo que toman medidas para maximizar la generacion energetica en las centrales, trazaran acertadamente el plan de largo alcance para resolver radicalmente la falta de electricidad, se enfocaran en su cumplimiento y generaran mas electricidad principalmente con los recursos hidraulicos y aprovechando asimismo la energia de la naturaleza como la eolica, la geotermica y la solar. Deben elevar la produccion en las minas carboniferas, resolver decisivamente el problema del transporte como el ferroviario y lograr innovaciones en cooperacion de las ramas de electricidad, carbon y transporte ferroviario, con el objetivo de impulsar el progreso economico del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs menester dedicar gran empeno en la industria ligera, renglon que desempena un gran papel en la mejora de la vida de la poblacion. A las fabricas de esta rama les corresponde acelerar con entusiasmo la modernizacion y la aplicacion de la tecnologia de CNC (control numerico computarizado ?N.T.) y lograr la estabilidad productiva al elevar la proporcion de uso de materias primas y materiales nacionales, mientras que todas las ciudades y distritos desarrollaran sus industrias acorde con la situacion de cada cual, para la mayor produccion de diversos articulos de consumo masivo de buena calidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso adoptar medidas estatales para desarrollar la pesqueria. A ese sector le corresponde modernizar barcos y otros equipos de pesca e impulsarla con metodos cientificos siguiendo el ejemplo de los pescadores del Ejercito Popular que lograron capturar gran cantidad de peces en fiel cumplimiento de la orden del Comandante Supremo, para que todos los barcos regresen a sus puertos haciendo sonar la sirena en senal de la gran pesca. Tambien le compete promover la maricultura en gran escala.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario proteger y aumentar de manera activa las riquezas del pais, entre ellas los recursos subterraneos, forestales y maritimos, e impulsar con energia la reforestacion con la participacion de todo el pueblo hasta que todas las montanas se conviertan en frondosos bosques.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todas las esferas de la economia nacional se fomentara el ahorro, ademas de aumentar la produccion aprovechando al maximo sus potencialidades productivas y reservas internas. Ahorrar es producir y por ese conducto se revela el patriotismo. Reinara en toda la sociedad el espiritu de ahorro para consumir con eficiencia un vatio de electricidad, un gramo de carbon y una gota de agua y prevalecera un ambiente en que todos aportan mas a la vida economica del pais con alto sentido de patriotismo y la conciencia de ser sus duenos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs menester mejorar decisivamente la direccion y la administracion de la economia. Se reforzara, bajo el liderazgo del Partido, la direccion unificada del Estado sobre las actividades economicas y se propiciara que las empresas realicen sus labores con mas responsabilidad y creatividad y que todos los trabajadores cumplan fielmente su mision y funciones como protagonistas de la produccion y la gestion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta dar grandes pasos de avance en la educacion y otras ramas de la cultura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe mejoraran el contenido educativo, el metodo didactico y las condiciones y el ambiente de la docencia conforme a la demanda de la revolucion y la epoca que progresa y se produciran cambios en las labores educacionales incluida la educacion secundaria general. A la salud publica le incumbe poner mas empeno en el tratamiento y la prevencion de enfermedades para el fomento de la salud de la poblacion, de modo que todos disfruten de mayores beneficios del sistema sanitario del socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl arte y la literatura son como trompeteros e impulsores de la ofensiva revolucionaria para la construccion de un Estado socialista poderoso y prospero. Se crearan muchas obras de gran valor ideologico y artistico que conmuevan el corazon de las personas y representen nuestro tiempo siguiendo el ritmo de la marcha de nuestra revolucion y la realidad palpitante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que avivar la fiebre del deporte en todas partes del pais. Los deportistas, con la ambicion de ser campeones mundiales, se entregaran mas al entrenamiento; se desarrollara la ciencia y tecnica deportiva; se materializara la orientacion de promover la participacion masiva en esa actividad para hacer realidad el proyecto del Partido de convertir nuestro pais en una potencia deportiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContinuaremos dedicando ingentes esfuerzos a elevar la capacidad de defensa nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsolidar las fuerzas armadas es la tarea mas importante del Estado y la potencial militar garantiza la dignidad de la nacion, la felicidad del pueblo y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe reforzara y desarrollara el Ejercito Popular como invencibles fuerzas armadas revolucionarias inspiradas en el espiritu del monte Paektu al total servicio del Partido y el lider, de la patria y el pueblo. A este efecto lo mas importante es fortalecer las companias, principales unidades de combate y centros de vida de los militares. Convertiremos todas las companias en fuerzas elite preparadas tanto en el plano politico-ideologico como en el tecnico-militar y en queridas familias llenas de hermandad. Se intensificara la educacion ideologico-politica de los militares para prepararlos como hombres de firme idea y conviccion, dispuestos a defender a riesgo de su vida el Palacio del Sol Kumsusan y el Comite Central del Partido. Mediante intensos ejercicios de combate y un movimiento de destacados tiradores de fusil y canon, los militares poseeran una punteria certera, complexion fuerte y espiritu de ferrea disciplina y se prepararan para combatir cada uno a cien enemigo\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea se estableceran firmemente el sistema de direccion del Partido y la disciplina revolucionaria para que sus miembros cumplan plenamente su noble mision y deber de defender al Lider, el regimen y el pueblo. La Guardia Roja Obrero-Campesina siempre estara lista para la batalla redoblando ejercicios militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la industria de defensa nacional le incumbe producir mayor cantidad de modernas armas tipicas ligeras, no tripuladas, inteligentes y precisas, los cuales multiplicaran nuestra capacidad de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs indispensable consolidar aun mas la base politico-ideologica de nuestra revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues ella constituye el baluarte que decide la victoria o la derrota en la batalla de defensa del socialismo y el fortalecimiento de las filas revolucionarias en lo politico e ideologico es la tarea mas importante para nosotros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este ano de significacion en que cumple 40 anos la declaracion del programa de transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el kimilsungismo elaborado por el gran General, fortificaremos al Partido en el plano organizativo-ideologico, formaremos a todos los miembros de la sociedad como kimilsungista-kimjongilistas y estrecharemos la unidad monolitica de las filas revolucionarias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso establecer firmemente en el seno del Partido el sistema de direccion unica, asegurar la pureza de las filas de sus miembros y elevar la funcion y el papel combativos de sus organizaciones. Intensificaran la educacion ideologica entre los cuadros, militantes y otros trabajadores para que sigan, en cualquier momento y lugar, unicamente a los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il y a nuestro Partido y piensen y actuen segun la idea y voluntad del Partido. Se mantendran alerta ante cualquier manifestacion y factor que afecte y perjudique la unidad de las filas del Partido y la revolucion, por insignificante que sea, y los eliminaran implacablemente. Necesita arreciar la lucha contra las ideas extranas y las corrupciones que minan nuestro regimen y frustrar totalmente las maniobras de la penetracion ideologica y cultural del enemigo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon miras a dar grandes saltos en todos los sectores de la construccion de un Estado socialista poderoso y prospero, es imprescindible activar al maximo la potencial espiritual de las masas. Esto es la mayor posibilidad de la creacion e innovacion y la clave fundamental para lograr exitos admirables. Es necesario realizar una dinamica campana de educacion ideologica, la de propaganda y agitacion, encaminada a incentivar la potencial espiritual de los militantes del Partido y otros trabajadores. Todos personificaran el patriotismo de Kim Jong Il y lo aplicaran en todos los aspectos de la practica, realizando meritos heroicos en la orgullosa empresa para construir un pais socialista rico, poderoso y civilizado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUrge establecer una firme disciplina y orden revolucionario en todos los campos de la lucha revolucionaria y la labor constructiva, factor importante para demostrar en alto grado la superioridad de nuestra sociedad regida por el colectivismo y obtener exitos en todas las tareas. En todos los sectores y unidades se cumpliran estrictamente las politicas y orientaciones del Partido y las leyes, resoluciones y directivas del Estado, y todos los funcionarios y trabajadores, conscientes de ser duenos de la sociedad y ciudadanos de la Republica, respetaran las leyes, las reglas y el orden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos cuadros deben esforzarse por todos los medios para cumplir su mision como miembros de mando de la revolucion y fieles servidores del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon absoluta lealtad hacia el Partido, alto sentido de responsabilidad y gran entusiasmo programaran ambiciosos proyectos y lucharan con teson para realizarlos hasta sus ultimas consecuencias, cumpliendo asi infaliblemente lo que el Partido se propone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomaran por norma inviolable de su trabajo la demanda y el interes del pueblo y se esforzaran para satisfacer sus deseos y gustos y para beneficiarlo. Respetaran con infinita sinceridad la demanda del pueblo, la voz de las masas, y siempre se comportaran y trabajaran como sus fieles servidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace 20 anos el gran Lider Kim Il Sung dejo su ultima firma en un documento de trascendencia historica relacionado con la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano, en cumplimiento de su legado y el del General, debemos lograr avances en el movimiento por reunificar el pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon miras a resolver el problema de la reintegracion territorial en correspondencia con el deseo y voluntad de los compatriotas, es preciso rechazar la intervencion de las fuerzas extranjeras y mantener con firmeza el principio de Entre nosotros, los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos protagonistas de la reunificacion del pais son todos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y en el ultramar y podemos lograrla de manera independiente de acuerdo con el interes y la exigencia de la nacion solo cuando nos atengamos al referido principio. Apelar a las fuerzas extranjeras para conseguir la “cooperacion internacional” en cuanto al problema de la nacion, el de las relaciones Norte-Sur, es un humillante acto servil y traicionero que deja el destino de la nacion a su libre albedrio. El Norte y el Sur deben mantener la independencia estipulada en los tres principios de la reunificacion del pais y la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur, sostener firmemente la posicion de Entre nosotros, los connacionales, y respetar e implementar fielmente las declaraciones conjuntas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs ineludible luchar por salvaguardar la seguridad y la paz de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicos estadounidenses y surcoreanos hacen freneticos ejercicios de guerra contra el Norte concentrando gran cantidad de armas nucleares en la Peninsula Coreana y en sus alrededores. Por eso se crea una situacion tan critica que un pequeno choque militar eventual puede desembocar en una guerra total. Si estalla aqui una nueva contienda, esta supondra una espantosa catastrofe nuclear, de la cual ni siquiera Estados Unidos puede estar a salvo. Todos los integrantes de la nacion coreana no deben permitir en absoluto las maniobras de enfrentamiento y de guerra de los belicistas del interior y exterior del pais y frustrarlas resueltamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUrge crear un ambiente propicio para mejorar las relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProvoca dolor el simple hecho de que la nacion este dividida por culpa de las fuerzas foraneas. Tambien resulta intolerable promover la difamacion, el antagonismo y la antipatia entre los compatriotas, situacion que puede ser aprovechada por las fuerzas extranjeras que no desean la reunificacion de Corea. Ha llegado el momento de poner el punto final a la calumnia inutil y danina, y no se debe permitir por mas tiempo el perjuicio a la reconciliacion y la unidad. A las autoridades surcoreanas les corresponde renunciar al enfrentamiento imprudente contra otra parte de la nacion y a la campana de reprimir el “pro-Norte”, asi como optar por mejorar las relaciones bilaterales en atencion a la demanda de los compatriotas, a favor de la independencia, la democracia y la reunificacion de la patria. Admitiremos a todos los que aprecian la nacion y desean la reintegracion, independientemente de su pasado, y tambien en el futuro, nos esforzaremos de modo activo por\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los compatriotas del Norte, el Sur y el extranjero, firmemente unidos bajo la bandera del patriotismo autentico, el ideal Entre nosotros, los connacionales, se levantaran con energia en la lucha a escala nacional para la reunificacion territorial, y abriran asi una nueva fase para la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado la intervencion y las maniobras de guerra de los imperialistas que amenazaban la independencia de los Estados soberanos y el derecho a vivir continuaron sin cesar en el ambito internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que destacar que en la Peninsula Coreana, el punto mas candente del mundo, se cernia el peligro de una inminente guerra nuclear debido a las maniobras de las fuerzas enemigas para eliminar a nuestra Republica, lo cual amenazo seriamente la paz y la seguridad de esta region y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa paz es muy valiosa para nuestro pueblo, pero no se logra solo con desearla o pedirla. No podemos permanecer indiferentes ante el nubarron de la guerra nuclear que nos amenaza permanentemente en la Peninsula Coreana y defenderemos firmemente la soberania y la paz del pais y la dignidad nacional con nuestra gran capacidad de defensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn lo adelante nuestro Partido y Gobierno, manteniendo inclaudicable el ideal de politica exterior de la independencia, la paz y la amistad, seguiran ampliando las relaciones de amistad y cooperacion con los paises que respetan nuestra soberania y nos tratan como amigos y no cejaran en el empeno por la paz y la seguridad del mundo y por la prosperidad comun de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnormes son las tareas que enfrentamos y existen dificultades en nuestro camino, pero nuestra causa revolucionaria que avanza bajo la bandera del gran kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo triunfara infaliblemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos, llenos de gran esperanza y firme fe y unidos compactamente con una sola idea y voluntad en torno al Partido, marchemos con pasos firmes por lograr victorias mas resonantes en el ano nuevo."
