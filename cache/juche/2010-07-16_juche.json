            "content": "S. Korea and US Joint War Maneuvers Assailed\r\n Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet war hawks blustered that they would stage joint naval exercises with the U.S. within July as part of the \"countermeasure\" against the case of sunk warship and conduct more than ten war maneuvers including the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises and an anti-submarine drill in the East Sea, the West Sea and the South Sea of Korea in a sustainable manner. \n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group had a confab with the U.S. over the issue of the joint naval maneuvers at the 26th meeting of the south Korea-U.S. \"security policy initiative\" held in Washington on July 9. It said that the group would make public a specific action plan at the \"diplomatic and defense chiefs talks\" with the U.S. due to be held in Seoul on July 21.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. military war-like forces declared they would massively hurl forces of the U.S. 7th Fleet including nuclear-powered carrier \"George Washington\" into the waters off south Korea to stage joint naval maneuvers larger than the preceding joint military exercises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea in a statement Friday vehemently denounced the projected large-scale joint maneuvers as extremely dangerous and reckless ones designed to harass the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and escalate the tension there and serious military provocations to the DPRK on behalf of all the Koreans and other peace-loving people of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warship case which the south Korean puppet group and the U.S. are using as a pretext for staging the above-said joint naval maneuvers faced a stern judgment of the domestic and foreign public as its conspiratorial nature was brought to light, the statement noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group referred the warship case, an anti-DPRK conspiratorial farce, to the UN only to suffer bitter disgrace, much less getting any recognition of the \"results of investigation\" announced by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves of the south Korean puppet group and the U.S. are intolerable as they are extremely reckless provocations to recover from the diplomatic defeat in the UN and persistently pursue the anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket and moves to tighten \"sanctions\" against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation proves with added clarity that it is none other than the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group that are harassing the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and the recent conspiratorial case was an extremely dangerous plot to ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never remain an onlooker to the projected provocative war maneuvers of the enemies. Should the group of traitors finally stage the above-said maneuvers together with the U.S., the army and people of the DPRK will consider them as a grave infringement upon its dignity and sovereignty and strongly react to them."
