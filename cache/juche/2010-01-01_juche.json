            "content": "Joint New Year Editorial  \r\n Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun, Josoninmingun and Chongnyonjonwi Friday published a joint editorial titled \"Bring about a radical turn in the people's standard of living by accelerating the development of light industry and agriculture once again this year that marks the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea\" on the occasion of the New Year.\n\t\t\t\t\t The following is the excerpt from it:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today our service personnel and people greet the New Year Juche 99 (2010) with the pride of being victors, who wrote a new history of great revolutionary upsurge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A heyday unprecedented in the history of the nation lies ahead of them, who are courageously rushing towards the world by tapping the inexhaustible potentials of Songun Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il is leading the campaign for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful nation to a brilliant victory as he steers the efforts to effect a great revolutionary upsurge on the strength of single-minded unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now all the service personnel of the Korean People's Army and all the people are offering their heartfelt thanks and the greatest glory to him who is shaping the brilliant future of the country and the revolution with unflagging energy and untiring leadership, and are filled with a firm determination to support the Party's cause to the last with intense loyalty and heroic feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year Juche 98 (2009) was a year of dramatic change, when a phenomenal age of realizing all the ideals of the people has come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il worked out a grand plan for making a decisive turn in the Korean revolution and the building of a thriving nation by effecting a new revolutionary upsurge and wisely led the efforts of the service personnel and people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After kindling the torch of a great upsurge in Kangson, home to the Chollima movement, he proposed launching the 150-day and 100-day campaigns successively, and took revolutionary measures to bring them to a victorious conclusion. His outstanding leadership ability was the source of impetus for the unprecedentedly great innovations and leap. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The matchless fighting spirit of the leader, who continued the forced march of high intensity to vibrant hard-fought fields for an upsurge throughout the year, burning his heart with noble love of his country and fellow people, gave free rein to the mental strength of all the service personnel and people and worked world-startling miracles across the country.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year's struggle etched in their hearts the truth that his decision is precisely practice and they will always emerge victorious when they follow him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year witnessed one remarkable event of knocking on the gate to a thriving nation after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful launch of man-made satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 and the successful second underground nuclear test by our own efforts and technology were a landmark event signaling the first victory in the building of a thriving nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The perfection of the Juche-based steel-making system in the Songjin Steel Complex and the attainment of the cutting edge of the CNC technology constitute a great victory of the great Juche idea and an auspicious event for the whole country and all the people that demonstrated our inexhaustible economic and technological potentials. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The firework displays on the Day of the Sun--birthday of President Kim Il Sung--, May Day and the WPK anniversary in October were a striking manifestation of the lofty ideals and ambition of the Korean people who are building a thriving nation and the rosy future of Songun Korea that is advancing under the leadership of the great Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The economy of the country entered the stage of full-scale upturn as all the people staged a life-and-death struggle under the leadership of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 150-day and 100-day campaigns were an unforgettable struggle that wrote the most brilliant chapter in the history of our great upsurge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole course of the heroic campaigns conducted by all the people, including the workers, clearly showed what kinds of miracles would be performed and what kinds of changes would be effected when we give free rein to the might of the harmonious whole of our leader, our Party and our people, in which the Party trusts the people and the people defend the Party and the leader at the risk of their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Production sharply increased in the sectors of basic industries, vanguards of the national economy, and the industry as a whole achieved revitalization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Structures of lasting value in the Songun era, like the Nyongwon Power Station, the Wonsan Youth Power Station, Waterway on the Miru Plain and Mansudae Street, were built across the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gasification project in the Namhung Youth Chemical Complex was completed, and dynamic efforts were made to upgrade major factories and other enterprises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year remarkable achievements were brought about in agricultural production and rural construction, many cooperative farms transformed into ideal villages appropriate to a prosperous country and the production foundations and potentials of the light-industry sectors, including the textile and food-processing industries, strengthened markedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Remarkable successes were achieved in the development of socialist culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the heat of the revolution in literature and the arts in the Songun era conducted under the energetic guidance of Kim Jong Il, masterpieces were produced and re-presented one after another in the fields of the cinema, opera, drama and music. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Examples of mass-based culture and the arts in the era of a great upsurge were set to inspire the whole country with revolutionary enthusiasm and militant spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung University, Wonsan University of Agriculture and other institutions of learning were refurnished splendidly, and sportspersons registered good results bringing great pleasure to the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victorious great upsurge of last year confirms that the DPRK is developing in leaps and bounds, and the day when the successful building of a thriving nation will be proclaimed is just approaching. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t New Year Juche 99 (2010) is a year of general offensive, when all-Party and nationwide efforts should be concentrated on improving the people's standard of living on the basis of the laudable victory and achievements of the great revolutionary upsurge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Our building of the country into an economic giant is aimed, to all intents and purposes, at radically improving the people's standard of living. When the people's living standards are decisively improved, hooray for socialism and singing of Arirang of prosperity can ring out louder across the country and the gate to a prosperous nation be opened.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year marks the 65th anniversaries of the founding of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea and the country's liberation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anniversary of the founding of the WPK will be an important occasion for demonstrating the mounting national spirit and mettle of the Korean army and people, who are adding brilliance to the undying exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung in building the Party and carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche and the human cause of independence, and are speeding up the building of a thriving socialist nation on the strength of the single-minded unity around the leadership of the revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should celebrate the anniversary as a great revolutionary event to be written down in the history of Kim Il Sung's nation by giving the fullest play to our ardent loyalty to the Party, great guide, that has opened up a bright future for the country and people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great upsurge we are bringing about as we make unheard-of creation and leap forward under the leadership of the Party has entered a new phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The might of the country's economy, including the heavy industry, was strengthened in the flames of the gigantic great upsurge, setting up a springboard for the country, already a politico-ideological and military power, to justifiably reach the status of an economic giant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now, based on the brilliant achievements of the great revolutionary upsurge, the Party is unfolding unprecedentedly grand plans and operations to bring about a decisive turn in the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm determination and will of the Party to enable the people, who have braved severe hardships together with the Party, to enjoy the blessing of socialism to their hearts' content by getting them relish the substantial fruits of the present great upsurge and realize without fail the noble intention and desire of President Kim Il Sung who devoted his heart and soul to the people all his life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t True to the intention of the Party, which regards it as the supreme principle in its activities to steadily improve the people's standard of living and spares nothing for them, we should channel all our efforts to improving the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To launch a sweeping campaign to bring about a drastic turn in improving the people's standard of living in the flames of the great revolutionary upsurge--this is the general orientation of this year's efforts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should conduct an all-Party and nationwide drive for improving the people's standard of living to ensure that the achievements of the great upsurge are followed by greater ones and this year becomes a prosperous year filled with the people's happiness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Bring about a radical turn in the people's standard of living by accelerating the development of light industry and agriculture once again this year that marks the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea!\" is a slogan we should uphold. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Light industry and agriculture are the major fronts in the efforts for improving the people's standard of living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great are the foundations of light industry and agriculture, which our Party has laid out with an eye on today against all odds. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An all-Party, nationwide effort should be directed to mass-producing consumer goods. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The light-industry sector should carry forward the upgrading of its factories and enterprises on a high level, and strive to improve the quality of the consumer goods. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Local-industry factories should be operated at full capacity, and units, as many as possible, should launch a campaign to turn out more daily necessities favoured by the public. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The agricultural sector should sharply increase the grain production by thoroughly applying the Party's policy of agricultural revolution, like improving the seeds, doing double cropping and improving potato and soya bean farming. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should strictly observe the requirements of the Juche farming method and introduce organic and other new farming methods and technologies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should ensure that the updated stockbreeding, fish farming and fruit production bases that have established a Juche-oriented breeding system and embodied the principle of profitability demonstrate their great effect in reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should radically increase the state investment in the fields related to the people's living, and all the sectors and units should supply fully and in time the raw and other materials needed for the production of light-industry goods. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should gain access to more foreign markets, and undertake foreign trade in a brisk way to contribute to economic construction and the improvement of the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The four vanguard sectors are the engine of the national economy and a key to solving the problem of the people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In December last year, Kim Jong Il kindled the flame for the new year's drive while inspecting the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex and placed the workers of the Songjin Steel Complex, who had perfected the Juche-based steel-making system, in the van of the great revolutionary upsurge in the Songun era. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The vanguard sectors, with a firm view that the development of light industry and agriculture depends on that of heavy industry, should push ahead with today's general offensive for improving the people's standard of living by means of increased production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Steel production leads to the production of grain and machinery. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of metal industry should increase the capacity of Juche iron production that relies on the domestic raw materials and fuel and scale without fail the targets of pig iron, steel and rolled steel production set by the Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of electric power industry should channel effort to run thermal power stations at full capacity and push ahead with the construction of large-scale hydroelectric power stations, including the Huichon Power Station. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of coal industry should produce coal without condition for the thermal power stations, chemical factories and other important units, and step up modernization projects to steadily enhance its production capacities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of rail transport should set an order and discipline as strict as in the army, produce new-type locomotives and freight cars in a larger number and make railway service modernized and railways heavy-duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of machine-building industry should extend the scope of introduction of the CNC technology on a high standard as required by the IT age, and effect a revolution in the production of tools, so as to produce high-performance, state-of-the-art machinery in a larger number.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should implement the people-oriented policies of the Party and the state to enable all the people to substantially enjoy the benefits of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true nature of our socialism lies in putting the people's well-being above anything else and providing them with all the benefits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should ensure that the advantages of the people-oriented policies, like giving free medical care and free education, formulated by President Kim Il Sung and applied by the Party and state throughout their history are given fuller play in the people's living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should speed up the construction of 100,000 flats in Pyongyang with those in Mansudae Street as a model, and build beautiful socialist streets and villages in a greater number in other urban and rural areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Socialist principles should be maintained in commodity circulation, and the quality of welfare service improved decisively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fundamental secret of making a new leap in this year's general offensive lies in launching a campaign to push back the frontiers of science and technology in all sectors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We must turn out as one under the slogan, \"Let us push back the frontiers of science and technology in all the sectors of the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country and leap higher and faster!\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of defence industry, a major front in pushing back the frontiers of science and technology, should continue to lead the efforts to open the gate to a great, prosperous and powerful country, and all other sectors and units of the national economy should launch a drive to push back the frontiers of science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bring science and technology close to production and put themselves on a modern and scientific basis in a far-sighted manner, focusing on enhancing their abilities to develop new technologies and products. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should map out a correct strategy for the development of science and technology as required by the 21st century, and rapidly develop core technologies, technical engineering of major sectors and basic science. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scientists and technicians should fulfil their role as the pioneers in pushing back the frontiers of science and technology and standard-bearers in making their country a scientific and technological giant, with a determination to glorify their country by means of their intelligence, their technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the sectors should conduct a vigorous mass technological innovation movement to push back the frontiers of science and technology and create new norms and records. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today's vibrant reality requires a revolutionary change in organizing economic work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The leading economic officials should map out aggressive and realistic business and management strategies, and actively push ahead with the advance of the current great upsurge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A strict discipline should be established in planning, financial management and labour administration, so as to give full play to the superiority of the highly-organized, socialist planned economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to maximize the speed of this year's general offensive, it is necessary to give steady play to the unconquerable mental strength of the service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party remains unchanged in its stand to persistently hold fast to the ideological strength, mental strength, no matter how the situation may change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe mental strength of our people is based on the strong will and fighting spirit of General \n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Party members and other people should become staunch revolutionaries and vanguard fighters, who, defending their leader unto death, translate into reality the idea of great upsurge and the far-reaching plans of the General, who continues his unremitting forced march for the benefit of his country and fellow people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The slogan \"When the Party is determined, we can do anything!\" must become the eternal motto of our people in their life and struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For us, who have to make a higher and faster leap towards the world, national dignity is as precious as life itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should thoroughly embody the Korean-nation-first spirit in all fields of social life as befits the people of a dignified power, who opened up an era of frontier science in which our satellite is circling the orbit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sector of art and literature should produce many masterpieces so as to give the fullest play to the mental strength of the service personnel and people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to achieve the goals set by the Party this year, we should strengthen in every way the might of our revolutionary ranks, whose core is the Korean People's Army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA should plan and conduct all forms of its military and political work on the highest level this year that marks the 50th anniversary of the start of the Songun-based revolutionary leadership of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il, thus giving fuller play to the inexhaustible might of the revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA is an elite force that has formed a harmonious whole with the Supreme Commander in idea and will, in disposition and pluck, and in feeling and emotion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should train all its men and officers into the vanguard fighters of the Songun revolution, holding aloft the slogan \"Let us defend with our very lives the leadership of revolution headed by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il!\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should ensure that it overflows with the soldiers' spirit of implementing without condition the orders and directives of the Supreme Commander by holding the work of establishing the revolutionary command system and military discipline as a priority task of the Party political work and developing the work without letup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should always remain highly alert without a moment of relaxation or indolence while keeping itself fully ready for combat action so that it can resolutely frustrate any surprise attacks of the enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The men and officers of the People's Army should continue to perform feats that would go down in history in the grand construction sites, including the Huichon Power Station, by displaying the revolutionary soldier spirit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the slogan \"Let us help the people!\" they should strengthen the unity between the army and the people, a foundation of Songun Korea, and become the role models for civilians in the ideological spirit, morality, sports and physical culture, the arts and all other aspects. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working class, youth and all other people, who are taking part in the effort for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country, should launch determined offensives, regarding their work places as battle fields. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our workers should create a new speed of advance in the spirit of having performed labour feats during the 150-day and 100-day campaigns. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth, who are a shock brigade in the great revolutionary upsurge, should make breakthroughs in the construction site of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station and other most difficult and labour-intensive posts and build more monumental edifices representing the Songun era, burning their hearts with the determination to move even the mountain if the Party calls them to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should become heroes, who add lustre to the era of great upsurge with undying labour feats, and talented persons, who highly demonstrate the dignity of the country by pushing back the frontiers of science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should strengthen the Party and remarkably enhance the role of Party organizations to achieve a brilliant victory in this year's general offensive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year, when we will be celebrating the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Party, Party organizations should give free rein to our Party's militant might, which was built in the tempest of the Songun revolution, by bringing about a fresh turn in the Party work. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should further intensify the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement, so as to ensure that the revolution in ideology, technology and culture is waged briskly at all units. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should defend the interests of the masses in a thoroughgoing way and solve all problems by relying on their strength as required by the revolutionary mass line of the Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials should become true servants of the people, who understand their sentiments and unfold their work as suited to these sentiments, and commanding personnel who, enjoy reputation and love among them, as they are possessed of free and easy character and ennobling humane traits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Party members, with a high political consciousness that they are the members of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea, should become skillful political activists and courageous fighters, who always hold the flag in the van in all fronts of making a great upsurge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working people's organizations should strengthen ideological education and briskly conduct various kinds of mass movements, like the socialist emulation movement among their members so as to give free rein to their patriotic enthusiasm in today's effort for building a great, prosperous and powerful nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year marks the 10th anniversary of the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The North-South Summit and the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in 2000 were a historic event that is of great significance in accomplishing the cause of national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, a new era of independent reunification has been opened, and great, unprecedented successes were achieved in the development of inter-Korean relations and the national reunification movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The previous ten years since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration followed by the publication of the October 4 declaration for its implementation, during which the Korean nation has advanced along the road for independent reunification and peace and prosperity, has clearly confirmed that these declarations are the most reasonable reunification programmes and the ideal of \"By our nation itself\" is the very national spirit and the one and only ideal in the June 15 reunification era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year, we took active and bold measures and made sincere efforts in order to improve the aggravated inter-Korean relations and bring a radical phase in national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our measures evoked great support and sympathy at home and abroad and created an atmosphere of dialogue and cooperation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The schemes of the separatist forces to thwart the advance of the era of June 15 reunification are vicious, but they cannot break the desire and will of the fellow countrymen to achieve independent reunification and national prosperity by implementing the north-south joint declarations, and it is inevitable that the pro-reunification, patriotic forces will prevail over the separatist forces and emerge victorious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year we should hold high the slogan \"Let the entire nation unite under the banner of north-south joint declarations and achieve national reunification at the earliest date!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The way for improving the north-south relations should be opened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unshakable is our stand that we will improve the north-south relations and open the way for national reunification on the basis of the historic June 15 joint declaration and October 4 declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities continue to negate the June 15 joint declaration and cling to the policy of confrontation in collusion with the foreign forces, the relations between the north and the south will never be improved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should refrain from committing acts that may aggravate the confrontation and tension, and take the road of respecting the inter-Korean declarations, promoting north-south dialogue and improving the relations between both sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National reconciliation and cooperation should be promoted actively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reconciliation should be promoted with the common national interests given precedence, and cooperation should be encouraged through travel and contacts between the people from all walks of life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All sorts of legal and institutional mechanisms that hinder the projects for common interests and prosperity of the nation should be abolished and free discussion and activities of the broad sections of the people for reunification should be fully ensured.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unity of the entire nation constitutes a decisive guarantee for the country's reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad should strengthen solidarity and collaboration to develop the national reunification movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should build up the atmosphere of independent national reunification, reconciliation, cooperation and unity on a nationwide scale to greet the 10th anniversary of the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the 30th anniversary of the proposal for the founding of the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The entire Korean nation should crown the year 2010 as a year of opening a new phase of independent reunification by frustrating all challenges of the anti-reunification forces with their concerted efforts and stepping up the grand nationwide march toward reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fundamental task for ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Asia is to put an end to the hostile relationship between the DPRK and the USA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to establish a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula and make it nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party and the government of our Republic will strive to develop relations of good-neighbourliness and friendship with other countries and achieve global independence under the unfurled banner of independence, peace and friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party is a great guide which steers our motherland and people to sure victory, and ours are heroic army and people who perform everything without fail once the Party has planned and decided to do it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The majestic firework display to be held on the auspicious October holiday will resound all over the world as a reflection of the determination of all the service personnel and people to follow the Party to the last along the road of Songun and the delight of all the people in

La Universidad Kim Il Sung, la Universidad de Agricultura de Wonsan y otros centros docentes se han acondicionado magnificamente conforme a las exigencias del siglo nuevo, y se lograron buenos resultados en las competiciones deportivas, que proporcionaron gran alegria a nuestro pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La relevante victoria del gran auge en el ano transcurrido comprueba que nuestra Patria esta corriendo con brio en su corcel veloz y se esta aproximando el dia historico en que sera declarada gran potencia prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   El Ano Nuevo 2010 es un ano de ofensiva general en que el Partido y el Estado deben concentrar todas sus fuerzas en el mejoramiento de la vida del pueblo sobre la base de los relevantes triunfos y exitos del gran auge revolucionario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   El gran Dirigente, camarada Kim Jong Il, senalo: “Nuestro objetivo de construir la potencia economica consiste, al fin y al cabo, en elevar trascendentalmente el nivel de la vida del pueblo. Si logramos este fin, podremos dar vivas al socialismo, escuchar la alta melodia de la cancion Arirang de la prosperidad en todo el pais, y abrir las puertas de la gran potencia prospera.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   El presente es un ano significativo en que coinciden el aniversario 65 de la fundacion del glorioso Partido del Trabajo de Corea y el 65 de la liberacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   El aniversario 65 de la constitucion del Partido sera una oportunidad significativa para dignificar las proezas imperecederas realizadas por el gran Lider, camarada Kim Il Sung, en la construccion del Partido, la causa revolucionaria del Juche y la empresa de la humanidad por la independencia, y exhibir el elevado espiritu nacional e invencible temple del ejercito y pueblo que, unidos en un haz en torno a la Direccion de la Revolucion, construyen la gran potencia socialista prospera. Hemos de desplegar una dinamica lucha manifestando al maximo la fidelidad al Partido, que ha abierto un futuro luminoso ante la Patria y el pueblo, con el proposito de conmemorar el aniversario 65 de la fundacion del Partido como un gran evento festivo revolucionario que se registrara con letras mayusculas en la historia de la nacion de            Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Nuestra marcha en gran auge ha venido avanzando con pasos firmes bajo la guia del Partido, dando riendas sueltas a la creacion y ascenso y anticipando anos y siglos, hasta el punto de acoger una nueva coyuntura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Al fortalecer el poderio economico del pais, sobre todo de la industria pesada, en medio del gran auge impetuoso, se ha preparado en nuestro pais el trampolin para saltar a la posicion de la potencia economica, como para completar su poderio de que hace gala como potencia politico-ideologica y militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En la actualidad nuestro Partido ha presentado un ambicioso proyecto y ejecuta operaciones sin precedentes para registrar un cambio decisivo en la vida del pueblo sobre la base de la brillante victoria del gran auge revolucionario. Es su firme decision y voluntad llevar al pueblo que ha atravesado por duras pruebas siguiendo al Partido, a disfrutar cuanto quisiera de la buena suerte que tiene bajo el socialismo, y materializar a toda costa el sublime proposito y anhelo del Lider paternal que consagro toda su vida para el pueblo, al ofrecerle beneficios reales provenientes de los exitos del gran auge actual. En acato al sublime proposito del Partido que presenta como el maximo principio de sus actividades mejorar incesantemente la vida del pueblo y no escatima nada por este hemos de dedicar todos los recursos al fomento de su bienestar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Lanzar una gran ofensiva para alcanzar un decisivo viraje en esta obra al promover con mas fuerza el gran auge revolucionario, esta es la general orientacion de este ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Debemos desplegar con impetu una ofensiva general en escala de todo el Partido y el Estado por la mejora de la vida del pueblo, para extender la victoria del gran auge y convertir este ano significativo en un ano de prosperidad que traiga felicidad para el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Tenemos que sostener en alto la consigna: “!Este ano del aniversario 65 de la fundacion del Partido, imprimamos un cambio decisivo en la vida del pueblo dando otro acicate a la industria ligera y la agricultura!”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La industria ligera y agricultura constituyen el frente principal en la lucha por la mejora de la vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Son formidables los cimientos de estas dos ramas que nuestro Partido ha venido colocando uno tras otro con vision de futuro en medio de las duras dificultades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Se debe producir gran cantidad de articulos de consumo popular concentrando los esfuerzos de todo el Partido y el Estado. Al sector de la industria ligera le compete seguir impulsando en alto nivel la modernizacion de las fabricas y empresas y esforzarse con teson por elevar la calidad de los productos. Es menester poner en pleno funcionamiento las fabricas de industria local y desplegar en todas las unidades posibles una gran campana para producir en mayor cantidad y diversidad los articulos de primera necesidad que gocen de buena aceptacion por parte del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En el sector de agricultura se debe aumentar notablemente la produccion materializando de modo cabal la orientacion del Partido sobre la revolucion de agricultura en varias esferas como el mejoramiento de la semilla, el desarrollo de cultivos dobles, de papa y soya. Hay que observar de modo riguroso los postulados del metodo autoctono de cultivo e introducir activamente nuevos metodos y tecnicas como el de cultivo con abonos organicos. Es preciso procurar que las modernas bases ganaderas, de acuicultura y fruticultura donde se ha establecido un original sistema de produccion de semillas y encarnado el principio de rentabilidad surtan grandes efectos en la realidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Hace falta aumentar de modo decisivo la inversion estatal en las ramas relacionadas con la vida del pueblo, y en todos los sectores y unidades deben suministrar a tiempo y de modo satisfactorio las materias primas y materiales necesarios a la produccion de los articulos de la industria ligera. Es preciso ganar mas mercados exteriores y desplegar de modo activo el comercio exterior, para contribuir a la construccion de la economia y la mejora de la vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Los cuatro sectores de avanzada son como la locomotora para la economia nacional y constituyen el eslabon clave de la solucion del problema de la vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En el pasado diciembre, el gran Dirigente       Kim Jong Il encendio la antorcha de la batalla del nuevo ano en el Complejo Siderurgico Kim Chaek y seguidamente presento al frente del gran auge revolucionario de la epoca de Songun a la clase obrera del Complejo de Acero de Songjin que logro perfeccionar el sistema de produccion de hierro Juche. En los referidos cuatro sectores, teniendo bien presente que el desarrollo de la industria ligera y agricultura depende de la industria pesada, deben impulsar con dinamismo la actual ofensiva general por el aumento del bienestar del pueblo generando un gran auge en la produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   De los materiales de acero salen tanto el arroz como las maquinas. En el sector de la industria metalurgica deben incrementar la capacidad de produccion de hierro Juche, basado en nuestras materias primas y combustibles, y alcanzar a todo trance la meta presentada por el Partido para la produccion de hierro colado, acero y materiales de acero laminados. Al sector de la industria electrica le incumbe impulsar energicamente la construccion de las centrales hidroelectricas de gran tamano, sobre todo, la de Huichon, mientras concentre las fuerzas en mantener las centrales termoelectricas en funcionamiento a toda capacidad. En la esfera de la industria carbonifera tienen que extraer incondicionalmente el carbon necesario a las centrales termoelectricas, las fabricas quimicas y otras entidades importantes y elevar constantemente su capacidad productiva mediante la modernizacion. En la rama del transporte ferroviario tienen que establecer una disciplina y orden rigurosos como en \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t el ejercito, producir muchas mas locomotoras y vagones, realizar la modernizacion del ferrocarril e introducir rieles pesados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Al sector de la industria mecanica le incumbe seguir promoviendo la introduccion en un alto nivel del CNC conforme a las exigencias de la epoca de la informatica y generar una revolucion en lo referente a los instrumentos para producir muchas maquinas y equipos de punta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Se deben ejecutar cabalmente las politicas populares del Partido y el Estado para propiciar que todo el pueblo sea el verdadero usufructuario de los beneficios socialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Nuestro socialismo tiene sus rasgos especificos en priorizar y absolutizar el bienestar del pueblo y ofrecerle todos los beneficios posibles. Hay que procurar que el sistema de la asistencia medica gratuita, el de la ensenanza obligatoria gratuita y demas politicas populares, establecidos por el padre Lider y mantenidos por nuestro Partido y Estado a lo largo de la historia, sirvan mejor a la vida de los habitantes. Se debe impulsar energicamente la construccion de viviendas para 100 mil familias en la ciudad de Pyongyang tomando como modelo las del reparto Mansudae y levantar mucho mas repartos y poblados pintorescos de aires socialistas en las ciudades y el campo. Hay que mantener cabalmente los principios socialistas en la circulacion de las mercancias y mejorar de manera decisiva los servicios publicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La clave fundamental para registrar un nuevo ascenso en la ofensiva general de este ano consiste en librar con osadia la lucha para aplicar la tecnologia de punta en todas las ramas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Bajo el lema de “!Conquistemos la cumbre tecnologica y saltemos mas alto y rapido en todos los frentes de la construccion de la gran potencia prospera!”, debemos movilizarnos como un solo hombre. Debemos lograr que en el sector de la industria de defensa nacional, frente principal en la batalla por la conquista de la cumbre tecnologica, siga sonando el fogonazo de la victoria que llame a las puertas de la gran potencia prospera, y que se levante una vigorosa campana para alcanzar la cumbre tecnologica en todas las ramas y unidades de la economia nacional. Debemos combinar la ciencia y tecnica con la produccion, y concentrando la atencion en el incremento de nuestra propia capacidad de desarrollar la tecnologia e inventar articulos, debemos llevar a cabo con vision de futuro la modernizacion y fundamentacion cientifica. Tenemos que elaborar correctamente la estrategia para desarrollar la ciencia y tecnica de acuerdo a las exigencias del siglo XXI y promover ac\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t eleradamente las tecnologias basicas medulares, las ingenierias tecnologicas de los sectores principales y las ciencias basicas. Los cientificos y tecnicos, con la determinacion de hacer grande a nuestra Patria a la vista del mundo, con su capacidad intelectual y tecnologica, tienen que desempenar el papel como soldados de avanzada para conquistar la cumbre tecnologica y como abanderados de la construccion de una potencia cientifica y tecnica. Por doquier se debe desarrollar con dinamismo el movimiento masivo por la innovacion tecnica, destinado a conquistar la cumbre tecnologica y crear nuevas normas y records.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La palpitante realidad de hoy exige mejorar por via revolucionaria la labor de organizacion economica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Los dirigentes de la economia tienen que dirigir por propia iniciativa el avance de hoy en gran auge, ateniendose a una emprendedora y realista estrategia empresarial y administrativa. Estableciendo una estricta disciplina en el cumplimiento del plan, la financiacion y la administracion laboral, deben poner de manifiesto la superioridad de la economia socialista planificada y altamente organizada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Con el fin de incrementar al maximo la velocidad del avance general de hoy, es imprescindible mantener en un auge permanente la ilimitada capacidad espiritual de miles y miles de militares y civiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La posicion de nuestro Partido de adherirse a la fuerza de la ideologia, al poderio del espiritu, es invariable, no importa que giro tome la situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La elevada capacidad espiritual de nuestro pueblo esta fundamentada en la firme voluntad y espiritu de ofensiva de nuestro estimado General. Todos los militantes y demas sectores de la poblacion deben ser resueltos revolucionarios y vanguardistas defensores a ultranza del lider, que hacen realidad la idea de gran auge y el proyecto de largo alcance del General. Es preciso que la consigna “!Si el Partido decide, lo cumplimos!” sea la eterna maxima de nuestro pueblo en su vida y lucha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Para nosotros, que debemos saltar mas alto y rapido de cara al mundo, la autoestima nacional es tan preciosa como la vida. Como un pueblo de la digna potencia que ha entrado en la epoca de tecnologia de punta con su satelite artificial navegando por el cosmos, debemos materializar a cabalidad el espiritu de dar primacia a la nacion coreana en todos los dominios de la vida social.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En el sector del arte y la literatura, deben producir muchas obras maestras para manifestar al maximo la capacidad espiritual de todo el ejercito y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Con miras a conquistar la meta de este ano presentada por el Partido, es insoslayable fortalecer por todos los medios el poderio de nuestras filas revolucionarias cuya medula es el Ejercito Popular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Este ano cuando se cumplen 50 anos del inicio de la direccion sobre la revolucion por el Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Il mediante el Songun, el Ejercito Popular debe manifestar en un grado mas alto su inagotable e insuperable poderio como ejercito revolucionario del Paektu, al proyectar y realizar en un nivel superior todas sus labores militares y politicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Nuestro ejercito es un destacamento elite monoliticamente unido y que comparte con el Comandante Supremo la misma ideologia y voluntad, el mismo temperamento y coraje y el mismo sentimiento y sensacion. Con la consigna “!Defendamos a vida o muerte la Direccion de la Revolucion encabezada por el gran camarada       Kim Jong Il!” en alto, debe formar a todos los oficiales y soldados como combatientes de vanguardia de la revolucion del Songun. Prestando la atencion principal en la labor politica partidista al asunto de establecer el sistema de direccion revolucionario sobre el ejercito y la disciplina militar, debe profundizarlo sin cesar para colmar todo el ejercito con el espiritu militar de cumplir incondicionalmente la orden del Comandante Supremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Debe estar siempre alerta sin caer en indolencia ni un momento y mantenerse en estado de movilizacion para rechazar rotundamente cualquier acto sorpresivo de provocacion de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular han de seguir acumulando relevantes meritos que brillaran en la historia, con su espiritu revolucionario, en las construcciones de grandes dimensiones como la Central de Huichon. Con la consigna de “!Ayudemos al pueblo!” en alto deben consolidar firmemente la unidad militar-civil, raiz de la Corea de Songun, y ser modelo para la sociedad en todos los aspectos: ideologico, espiritual, moral, deportivo y artistico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La clase obrera, los jovenes y otros sectores del pueblo, participantes valientes en la gran obra de la edificacion de una gran potencia prospera, tienen que esforzarse con abnegacion en sus correspondientes puestos de trabajo, considerandolos como trincheras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Nuestros obreros deben crear una nueva velocidad de avance con el mismo impetu y vigor con que alcanzaron proezas en las Batallas de los 150 dias y de los 100 dias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Los jovenes, brigada de choque para el gran auge revolucionario, con su ardiente pasion de mover incluso los montes si se lo exige el Partido, han de abrir puntos de ruptura en los frentes mas arduos y dificiles como la construccion de la Central Juventud Songun del Paektu y levantar mayor cantidad de creaciones monumentales de la epoca de Songun. Deben ser heroes que realizando hazanas imperecederas hagan resplandecer la epoca del gran auge y talentos que cubran con honor a la Patria al dominar la cumbre tecnologica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Con miras a lograr brillantes victorias en la ofensiva general del ano presente es preciso fortalecer el Partido y elevar considerablemente el papel de sus organizaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Este ano, del aniversario 65 de la fundacion del Partido, sus organizaciones deben imprimir en su labor un nuevo viraje y poner de pleno manifiesto su poderio combativo consolidado en medio de la tempestad de la revolucion del Songun. Deben profundizar el Movimiento por la Obtencion de la Bandera Roja de las Tres Revoluciones, para tremolar las banderas ideologica, tecnica y cultural en todos los lugares de trabajo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Conforme a la linea revolucionaria para las masas trazada por el Partido, hay que defender y satisfacer de modo consecuente sus intereses y resolver todos los problemas apoyandose en ellas. Los cuadros han de ser verdaderos servidores del pueblo que sepan mover sus corazones y trabajar de acuerdo con sus opiniones publicas, y jefes de confianza dotados con cualidades sencillas y nobles virtudes humanas y que disfruten de respeto y amor de las masas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Todos los miembros del Partido, con alta conciencia politica de formar parte del glorioso Partido del Trabajo de Corea, tienen que ser activistas politicos competentes y valientes combatientes de choque que por dondequiera redoblen antes que nadie el tambor del gran ascenso, y siempre avancen con la bandera enhiesta, a la cabeza de las filas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   A las organizaciones de trabajadores les compete intensificar la labor de educacion ideologica y desplegar activamente diversos tipos de movimientos de masas como la emulacion socialista, de manera que todos sus integrantes pongan al rojo vivo su entusiasmo patriotico en la magna batalla actual por la construccion de una gran potencia prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En el presente ano se cumple el decimo aniversario de la publicacion de la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La publicacion de esta Declaracion y el encuentro Cumbre de ambas partes en 2000 fueron un evento de gran importancia historica para la reunificacion nacional. Como consecuencia, se abrio una nueva epoca para la reintegracion independiente y se registraron exitos nunca vistos antes en el movimiento por esta causa y en el desarrollo de las relaciones Norte-Sur. Los ultimos diez anos en que se adoptaron la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y su programa practico, la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, y nuestra nacion avanzaba por el camino de reunificacion independiente, paz y prosperidad, comprobaron evidentemente que las mencionadas Declaraciones son las mas justas y magnas plataformas de la reunificacion, y “Entre nosotros, los connacionales” constituye el espiritu nacional e ideal unico en la epoca de reunificacion del 15 de Junio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En el ano pasado, tomamos por iniciativa medidas audaces para mejorar las relaciones empeoradas entre el Norte y el Sur y abrir una coyuntura trascendental para la reintegracion de la Patria, y nos esforzamos con sinceridad para implementarlas. Estos empenos recibieron grandes apoyos y simpatias en el interior y exterior del pais y crearon una atmosfera idonea al dialogo y la cooperacion entre ambas partes. Aunque las fuerzas divisionistas internas y externas maniobran con frenesi para frenar el avance de la epoca del 15 de Junio, no podran doblegar la aspiracion y la voluntad de la nacion de lograr la reunificacion independiente y la prosperidad nacional a traves de la puesta en practica de las Declaraciones Conjuntas Norte-Sur. Es inevitable que las fuerzas patrioticas pro-reunificacion predominen y salgan victoriosas sobre las que persiguen la escision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En el presente ano debemos levantar la consigna de “!Logremos cuanto antes la reunificacion de la Patria, con la unidad de toda la nacion, bajo la bandera de la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur!”\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Hay que abrir el camino para mejorar las relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Es invariable nuestra posicion de mejorar las vinculaciones entre ambas partes y allanar el sendero para la reintegracion del pais sobre la base de las dos declaraciones mencionadas. Si las autoridades surcoreanas se niegan a la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y siguen persiguiendo el enfrentamiento con el Norte en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras, las relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur no podran mejorar nunca. Las autoridades surcoreanas no deben agravar el enfrentamiento y la tension, sino respetar los postulados de la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur y optar por el camino del dialogo y el mejoramiento de las relaciones entre ambas partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Hay que promover la reconciliacion y cooperacion nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Se debe poner en el primer plano los intereses comunes de la nacion, facilitar la reconciliacion y fomentar la cooperacion mediante los viajes y contactos entre diversos sectores y capas. Han de ser eliminados todos los dispositivos legales e institucionales que impiden los esfuerzos por los intereses y prosperidad comunes de la nacion y asegurados los debates y actividades libres de amplias masas populares por la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La unidad de toda la nacion es la garantia decisiva para la reunificacion de la Patria. Todos los compatriotas del Norte, el Sur y el extranjero deben desarrollar el movimiento por la reintegracion del pais mediante la intensificacion de la solidaridad y la union. Con motivo del aniversario 10 de la publicacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y del aniversario 30 de la presentacion del Proyecto de la Fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo, hay que estimular el animo por la reunificacion independiente y calentar el ambiente de la reconciliacion, cooperacion y unidad a escala pannacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Toda la nacion coreana, con sus fuerzas unidas tiene que dar al traste con todos los desafios de las fuerzas anti-reunificacion, y apresurar la gran marcha pannacional por la reintegracion a fin de adornar brillantemente el 2010 como un ano en que se abra una nueva coyuntura para la reintegracion independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En la actualidad, el asunto fundamental que se presenta para garantizar la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region cercana es poner fin a la relacion hostil entre Corea y Estados Unidos. Es invariable nuestra posicion de establecer un sistema de la paz duradera en la Peninsula Coreana y realizar su desnuclearizacion por medio de los dialogos y las negociaciones. Nuestro Partido y Gobierno de la Republica, bajo la bandera de la independencia, la paz y la amistad, estrecharan las relaciones de buena vecindad y amistad con otros paises y lucharan energicamente para verificar la independencia en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Nuestro Partido es el gran orientador que conduce la Patria y el pueblo hacia la victoria y nuestro Ejercito y pueblo son un ejercito y pueblo heroicos que si el Partido proyecta o decide algo, lo cumplen a todo trance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Las magnificas salvas artificiales que se lanzaran en el cielo de octubre festivo retumbaran en todo el universo como salvas del juramento de miles y miles de militares y civiles de seguir hasta el fin por el camino del Songun en pos del Partido, y como salvas de la alegria porque todo el pueblo goza de fortuna de vivir en el regimen socialista autentico."
