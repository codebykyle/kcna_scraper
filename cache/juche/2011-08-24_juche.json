He consolidated the foundation of the Songun politics by directing primary efforts to developing the People's Army into the army of the leader and party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He formulated the philosophy of arms that the revolution starts, advances and is consummated with arms and the principle of Songun that an army precisely means a party, state and people. He, at the same time, established the Songun politics as a basic political mode of socialism on the basis of an original clarification of the issue of driving force for the revolution, thereby providing effective ideo-theoretical guidelines guaranteeing the triumphant advance of the cause of independence against imperialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to the wise leadership of the great brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu that the KPA fully displayed the might of Songun Korea by resolutely foiling the anti-DPRK confrontation rackets of the U.S. imperialists and the puppet group of traitors of south Korea such as \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case, Yonphyong Island shelling and hideous provocative acts of hurting the ideology and system in the DPRK and the dignity of its leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast will of the WPK to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, which started in Mt. Paektu, by dint of Songun generation after generation with the last instructions of the President as important guidelines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having pushed the inter-Korean relations to total collapse since the very day of their seizure of power, the south Korean puppet group of traitors are busy staging large-scale madcap Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises in the wake of the conspiratorial cases and unprecedented provocations against the DPRK in collusion with the U.S. imperialists in a desperate bid to stifle the ideology and system in the DPRK and its cause at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never pardon the U.S. imperialists and the warmongers of the south Korean puppet army keen to escalate confrontation with the DPRK and ignite a new war quite contrary to the trend of times. They will surely achieve the historic cause of national reunification with the might of Songun they have built up generation after generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Immensely rosy is the future of the army and people of the DPRK advancing under the tested and seasoned leadership of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il and final victory is in store for them."

De esta manera, preparo la gran guia ideo-teorica que posibilita  garantizar el avance victorioso de la causa de la independencia antiimperialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Gracias a la sabia orientacion del gran General Insigne del Paektu, el EPC pudo demostrar el poderio de la Corea del Songun frustrando tajantemente  la campana conflictiva anti-RPDC  de los imperialistas norteamericanos y la banda titere del Sur de Corea tales como el caso de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\", el incidente de canonazo en la isla Yonphyong y otras provocaciones que denigran la idea, el regimen y la maxima dignidad de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Considerar el legado del Presidente como guia programatica y llevar a feliz termino de generacion en generacion con el poderio del Songun la causa revolucionaria del Juche, es la firme voluntad del PTC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Desde el primer dia de su mandato la banda titere del Sur de Corea llevo las relaciones intercoreanas a la ruptura total e invento con EE.UU. groseros complots anti-RPDC y perpetro acciones  provocativas sin precedentes. Y  no satisfecho con esto, esta desarrollando los ejercicios militares conjuntos de gran envergadura \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" con el designio de aplastar de todos modos la idea, el regimen y la causa de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El ejercito y pueblo de Corea no perdonaran ni en lo minimo el alboroto conflictivo anti-RPDC y las maniobras de provocacion de nueva guerra de los imperialistas norteamericanos y de las fuerzas belicistas de la capa militar surcoreana, que marchan a contrapelo de la tendencia de la epoca, y lograran sin falta con el poderio del Songun la causa historica de la reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Sera mas radiante el futuro del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea que avanzan siguiendo la probada y veterana direccion del Comandante Supremo       Kim Jong Il y el triunfo final sera el de la RPDC."
