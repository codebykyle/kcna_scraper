Moreover, it prodded human scum into the operation for scattering leaflets slandering dignity and social system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The group's confrontation row is an unpardonable insult to all Koreans desirous of national reconciliation and unity and a blatant challenge to the unanimous desire of the fellow countrymen for reunification. It is also an intolerable hideous provocation to the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The vulgar, ignorant, incompetent and hysteric Lee Myung Bak and his group steeped in sycophancy and extreme enmity against fellow countrymen to the marrow of their bones are bound to opt for confrontation and war. This was fully evidenced by the past five years of his office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The madcap confrontation racket kicked up by Lee, Kim Kwan Jin, Ryu U Ik and other human scum from the outset of the year is a revelation of its wicked and dangerous nature to make the next regime carry forward its confrontation policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans should rise up as one in the final nation-wide struggle to mercilessly wipe out the Lee group of rats, the root cause of the nation's misfortune and sufferings, which is keen on the moves to bring the tragedy of bigger disasters to the nation through extreme confrontation with fellow countrymen after blocking the Koreans in their way to achieve reunification in the idea of \"By our nation itself\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans should resolutely meet the challenge of the anti-reunification forces by their concerted efforts and open a new phase of national reunification under the banner of the north-south joint declarations."
