            "content": "DPRK Institute of International Studies Exposes U.S. Nuclear Crimes\r\n Pyongyang, September 26 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Institute of International Studies Monday released a memorandum exposing the nuclear crimes of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t It recalls that the U.S. \"Manhattan Plan\" and the nuclear disasters inflicted by it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were aimed at exterminating mankind and using innocent people as guinea pigs, the memorandum noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. real intention of using nukes was to browbeat the progressives and bring the world to its knees by showing the destructive power of the bombs in the eyes of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. made no scruple of hatching unethical plots and committing monstrous crimes for establishing an unchallenged monopoly on nukes and making our planet subject to chains of nuclear weapons in a bid to threaten the existence of mankind with nuclear sticks in every part of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deployed about 800 nukes in Okinawa, 600 in south Korea, 225 on Guam, 60 in the Philippines and 12 in Taipei, China in 1960, bringing the number of nukes to some 1,700 in total in Asia-Pacific. The number of nukes increased to 3,200 in 1967. The U.S. deployed at least 1,000 nukes in south Korea, in particular, in 1975 and more than 1,720 in 1985, according to the minutes of the \"National Assembly\" of south Korea in 1985.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In November 1948 Truman laid down \"nuclear blackmail strategy\" calling for making nuclear strike at the depth of socialist countries. But when the U.S. failed to establish monopoly on nukes, it came out with the doctrine for establishing \"world domination with an unchallenged edge of strength\" and put forth the \"strategy for preempting the operation for containing surrounding countries,\" the strategy making the Soviet Union and progressive countries in its vicinity targets of attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean War which broke out in June 1950 was the first war in which the above-said strategy was put into practice. On November 30, 1950 Truman directly gave the U.S. Strategic Flying Corps an instruction to make preparations for dropping A-bombs. In December MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces in the Far East, brought an aircraft carrier with A-bombs aboard to the sea off Inchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. defeat in the Korean War became clear, its warmongers vociferated about \"large-scale retaliation strategy\". In August 1953 right after the ceasefire the U.S. worked out the top-secret plan 8-53 for massively dropping nuclear bombs in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula and attempted to ignite a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal nature of the U.S. nuclear war policy found the most vivid expression in its nuclear policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the DPRK-U.S. talks were kicked off, the Clinton Administration made assurance that the latter would neither use nor threaten the DPRK with armed forces including nukes but staged a series of mock nuclear attack drills targeting the DPRK at a military base in North Carolina State from January in 1998.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bush II totally overturned the October 21, 1994, DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and the October 12, 2000, DPRK-U.S. joint communique and listed the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" and a target of a preemptive nuclear attack upon it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the joint statement issued at the six-party talks on Sept. 19. 2005, the U.S. confirmed that there is no intent to attack or invade the DPRK with nukes or conventional weapons but at the annual security consultative meeting with south Korea in 2006 it went in the opposite direction by reiterating its plan to introduce nuclear carriers, nuclear submarines and strategic bombers and other latest nuclear war means in peace times, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration excluded the DPRK from the object of non-use of nuclear weapons in the \"report on nuclear posture review\" in April, 2010. In the \"quadrennial defense strategy review report\" in March, 2014 it openly defined the DPRK as \"the country posing a direct threat to it\" and undisguisedly cried out for \"containing it with nuclear force\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to this scenario, the U.S. pushed the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war through the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drills with the south Korean warmongers in 2015. It staged the largest-ever Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 in March and Ulji Freedom Guardian nuclear war drill in August this year with all type  nuclear war means involved. It recently decided to deploy THAAD in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. exists on the earth, the world without nuclear weapons is no more than a daydream and our planet will be in peace only when it is free from its aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to Juche Korea, nuclear power of independence and justice, mankind's ideal to live independently and peacefully on our planet free from a war will surely come true."

A base de ello, organizaron la comision suprema politico-militar en noviembre de 1941 para tener el arma nuclear antes que la Alemania fascista a fin de exterminar la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn agosto de 1942, se instituyo una zona especial para el desarrollo de armas nucleares en Los Alamos del Estado de Nuevo Mexico, de modo que se pusiera en practica el \"plan de Manhattan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesoyendo la opinion de los cientificos de que la bomba nuclear de uranio debe pasar la prueba de explosion, EE.UU. la lanzo primero sobre Hiroshima el 6 de agosto de 1945.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTres dias despues, volvio a tirar la bomba nuclear de plutonio sobre Nagasaki. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa verdadera intencion de EE.UU. fue demostrar con hechos el poder destructivo de esas armas diabolicas para intimidar a las fuerzas progresistas y doblegar a todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara monopolizar las armas nucleares y tomar la supremacia absoluta, EE.UU. no vacila en cometer los complots y fechorias de lesa humanidad y amenaza gravemente la existencia de la humanidad esgrimiendo a sus caprichos el garrote nuclear por doquier de nuestro planeta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Despues de la primera prueba nuclear realizada en 1945 hasta finales de diciembre de 1994, EE.UU. perpetro las pruebas nucleares en mil 32 ocasiones (segun el numero de agosto de 1995 de la revista australiana Estudios del Pacifico) y hasta el ano 1967, aumento a mas de 32 mil 500 el numero de armas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA eso de 1960, tenia mil 700 armas nucleares, aproximadamente, en la region de Asia-Pacifico, especificamente, alrededor de 800 en Okinawa, 600 en el Sur de Corea, 225 en la isla Guam, 60 en Filipinas y 12 en Taiwan de China. Y en el ano 1967, su numero crecio a 3 mil 200. En particular, hasta el ano 1975, se emplazaron en el Sur de Corea mas de mil armas nucleares (de acuerdo con las declaraciones hechas en mayo de 1975 por el representante Ronald Dellums ante el Congreso norteamericano), y en 1985, esa cifra se incremento a mas de mil 720 (el acta de reunion de la \"Asamblea Nacional\" del Sur de Corea sesionada en 1985). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTruman, quien presento en noviembre de 1948 la \"estrategia de chantaje nuclear\" consistente en atacar con armas nucleares las profundidades de los paises socialistas, amplio su doctrina como la de \"dominar el mundo con la supremacia absoluta de las fuerzas\" cuando se ha roto su monopolio nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, planteo la \"estrategia de disuasivo previo del contorno\" que incluye en la lista de blancos de ataque a la Union Sovietica y hasta los paises progresistas circunvecinos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl primer paso de cumplimiento de esa estrategia fue la guerra de agresion a Corea, estallada en junio de 1950. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 30 de noviembre de 1950, Truman dio personalmente a la aviacion estrategica norteamericana la orden de preparar el lanzamiento de bomba nuclear y en diciembre, el comandante de las fuerzas norteamericanas en el Extremo Oriente MacArthur introdujo en el mar frente a Inchon el portaaviones cargado de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl planear el lanzamiento de gran cantidad de sustancias radiactivas, inclusive plutonio y residuos nucleares, en el medio de la Peninsula Coreana (segun \"Guerra radiactiva\", informe del Buro Federal de Investigacion de EE.UU. fechado 20 de abril de 1951), realizo hasta 1952 en 65 ocasiones los ejercicios en campana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEisenhower firmo en diciembre de 1952 la operacion de \"nueva ofensiva\", que preve la movilizacion de medios nucleares en el frente coreano, y declaro abiertamente en enero de 1953 que \"no repararia en el uso de bomba nuclear\", de modo que sumaran cientos de miles de \"refugiados de bomba atomica\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando se hizo evidente su derrota en la guerra coreana, los belicistas estadounidenses insistieron en la \"estrategia de represalia masiva\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn agosto de 1953, poco despues del cese de fuego, elaboraron el plan de operacion supersecreta \"8-53\" de lanzar gran cantidad de bombas nucleares en la parte septentrional de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde 1954 hasta finales de la decada de 1950, desplegaron 143 mil 500 efectivos agresores en la region de Asia-Pacifico, 313 mil en Europa Occidental, 40 mil en la sexta flota norteamericana, o sea, cerca de medio millon en total, para ejercer la amenaza nuclear contra los Estados soberanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"plan operativo integral y unido (SIOP) 62\" de EE.UU., puesto en marcha en abril de 1961, fue el plan de guerra nuclear total que preve golpear con 3 mil 200 armas nucleares mil 60 blancos definidos en los paises socialistas y repetir el ataque con mil 706 artefactos nucleares contra 725 objetivos en el caso de contraataque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"estrategia de reaccion flexible\", inventada en febrero de 1962 por el secretario de Defensa McNamara, el presidente de la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor, Taylor, y otros, fue la doctrina mas cruel de las administraciones de Kennedy y Johnson que exigen \"la preparacion flexible\" tanto para la guerra nuclear total como para la guerra local y la especial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMas tarde, la politica de garrote nuclear se hizo mas amplia y profunda mediante la \"estrategia de detencion realista\" de Nixon, la \"de ataque preventivo nuclear\" de Carter, el plan de la \"Guerra de las Galaxias\" (proyecto de defensa estrategica) y la \"estrategia de enfrentamiento directo\" de Reagan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del fin de la Guerra Fria, EE.UU. presento la \"estrategia win-win\" que planea triunfar al mismo tiempo en las dos guerras y elevo mas el grado de amenaza y chantaje nucleares provocando al fin y al cabo la Guerra del Golfo Persico y la de ex Yugoslavia. Con motivo del incidente del 11 de Septiembre de 2001, presento la nueva doctrina de la llamada \"guerra antiterrorista\" y cometio las invasiones armadas contra Afganistan, Irak y Libia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos anos, los belicistas nucleares yanquis renuevan incesantemente los misiles balisticos intercontinentales, los submarinos nucleares y los bombarderos estrategicos nucleares, tres componentes de las fuerzas armadas estrategicas, y, por otra parte, aceleran el desarrollo de las 5 ojivas nucleares de nuevo tipo, incluyendo la bomba \"B61-12\", y las armas nucleares de cuarta generacion, asi como los bombarderos ultrasonicos sin piloto \"X-51A\"y \"X-43A\" capaces de cargar ojiva nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl memorando revelo las fechorias que cometieron los sucesivos politicastros norteamericanos enganando a la humanidad con consignas vistosas como el \"uso nuclear con fines pacificos\", el \"desarme nuclear\", la \"no proliferacion nuclear\" y el \"mundo sin armas nucleares\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa naturaleza criminal de EE.UU. se demuestra de manera mas coherente en su politica nuclear hacia la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando se abrieron por primera vez las conversaciones RPDC-EE.UU., la administracion Clinton prometio a la RPDC \"no usar ni amenazar con las fuerzas armadas incluyendo las nucleares\" (Declaracion Conjunta RPDC-EE.UU. aprobada el 11 de junio de 1993). Pero, desarrollo en varias ocasiones desde enero de 1998 el simulacro de ataque nuclear contra la RPDC en una base militar de Carolina del Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBush II revoco el Acuerdo Basico RPDC-EE.UU. firmado el 21 de octubre de 1994 y el comunicado conjunto RPDC-EE.UU. aprobado el 12 de octubre de 2000 y definio a la RPDC del \"eje del mal\" y blanco de ataque preventivo nuclear (su mensaje del Ano Nuevo pronunciado el 30 de enero de 2002 y en el reporte de revision de disposicion nuclear publicado en marzo de 2002).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la declaracion conjunta publicada el 19 de septiembre de 2005 en las conversaciones a 6 bandas, EE.UU. afirmo que su pais \"no tiene la voluntad de atacar o agredir a la RPDC con las armas nucleares o las convencionales\". Pero, actuo en contra de sus palabras, al reafirmar en la reunion consultiva anual de seguridad con el Sur de Corea convocada en 2006 la decision de introducir en el tiempo ordinario tambien los portaaviones nucleares, submarinos nucleares, bombarderos estrategicos y otros pertrechos ultramodernos de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el \"reporte de revision de la disposicion nuclear\" publicado en abril de 2010, la administracion Obama excluyo a la RPDC de la lista de blancos de no uso de armas nucleares. Y en marzo de 2014, definio a la RPDC como \"Estado directamente amenazante\" en el \"informe de revision de estrategia cuatrienal de defensa nacional\" y declaro abiertamente el \"aplastamiento con armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun ello, en 2015, llevo al borde de guerra nuclear la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana librando junto con los belicistas surcoreanos los ejercicios conjuntos Ulji Freedom Guardian. Y al desplegar en marzo de este ano, los simulacros de mayor envergadura Key Resolve y Foal Eagle 16, y desde agosto, la otra version de Ulji Freedom Guardian movilizando todos los medios de guerra nuclear. Y recientemente, decidio emplazar el sistema antimisiles THAAD en el suelo surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras exista EE.UU., el mundo sin armas nucleares no pasa de ser un sueno. Nuestro planeta podra vivir en paz cuando desaparezca el imperio norteamericano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a la Corea del Juche, potencia nuclear independiente y justiciera, se realizara sin falta el ideal de la humanidad de vivir de manera independiente y en paz en el planeta donde no haya la guerra."
