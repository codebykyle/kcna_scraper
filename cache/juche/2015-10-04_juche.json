            "content": "Kim Jong Un Makes Speech at Inauguration Ceremony of Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station\r\n Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, made a speech at the inauguration ceremony of the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station.\n\t\t\t\t\t The following is its full text:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDear trustworthy young vanguard, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDear guests,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDear comrades, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToday, amid warm congratulations of all the service personnel and people, we are making public to the whole world the inauguration of the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConstruction of the gigantic power station that demonstrates the indomitable mettle of the young people in the Songun era, who follow our great Workers' Party of Korea, is a great event that adds brilliance to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Party and promises a bright future of our dignified State. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHere, at this power station construction site at the foot of Mt Paektu where a legendary tale of heroic youth has been created, our trustworthy young people have built their grand monument shedding patriotic sweat and blood in the spirit of death-defying implementation and raising an envy of the whole world, and have thus fully lived up to the expectations of the Party Central Committee. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnswering with their burning hearts the Party's militant call to build the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station by the 70th anniversary of Party founding as befits a grand youth monument in the Songun era, our young people have performed in this Paektu area feats of labour most brilliant in the history of the youth movement of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade, vanguard fighters of our Party, have unsparingly devoted the strength and passion of their precious youth, building dams for several years in these deep, rugged mountain valleys far away from the capital city of Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo words will be enough to describe fully the feats of labour of the shock brigade members, who have built dams and dug waterway tunnels inch by inch breaking rocks and moving mountains with sledgehammers and crow bars for several years in the face of biting northern cold. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen even means of transport were frozen in intense cold, they transported building materials with large and small sledges; the death-defying corps members bolstered up the railway bridges with their bodies in the icy water of the Sodu. Everyone will bow to the revolutionary, self-sacrificing and patriotic spirit they and other young people have displayed in building the power station. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn particular, they have carried within some 120 days the amount of work equal to what they did in the previous 10 years by working day and night with the youthful courage and mettle of Paektu which our Party gave them, and built the dam of power station No. 1. This is a fruition of the patriotic devotion and loyalty of the builders including the young people of Paektu, who have all turned out in adorning our Party's history of building a youthful power with proud labour successes; it is also a legendary tale of heroic youth that can be created only by the young people of Korea who have been educated and trained in the embrace of the Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the course of building the dam of power station No. 1 our young people have grown up into heroes of the times, into giant artists of creation, and proved in practice our Party's history of attaching importance to young people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe dam rising over there is the accumulation of the burning patriotism and loyalty cherished by our young vanguard, and the height of the dam of power station No. 1 is the height of the dignity of our country with heroic young people, a youthful power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBusy as they were with building the power station, the youth shock brigade members and young soldiers built beautiful socialist villages for the people, who were living in the districts to be inundated, and planted trees and flowers in the area of the power station. This working manner testifies to the ennobling world of loyalty of our young people, who implement death-defyingly every single policy advanced by the Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the monumental structures built on this land carry the heroic feats of our young people, and many of them are named in honour of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are no young people in the world as laudable as ours who volunteered to work in this remote mountainous area, not in the flourishing urban quarters, and find the worth of living in carrying out the Party's intention, and who cultivate themselves in a revolutionary way by working out the curriculum of \"Paektu Youth University\" and giving marks to their conscience every moment and every day on their own. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen I saw the proud shock brigade members working, I felt deeply grateful to them and I felt like raising them high up in the sky with my arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhenever our revolution faced trials and difficulties, those who buttressed my mind were the young people who volunteered to start their career at the construction site of this power station and won the diploma of the \"youth university\" after working with patriotic devotion in the Paektu area. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the moment the problem of young people is the most knotty one in the hot and disputed areas of the world, but our young people serve our Party as its spiritual buttress, as its solid cornerstone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station has been built in the situation worse than other construction projects; when I think of the young people who have performed heroic feats in building it, I feel a soaring indomitable will to carry out the revolution for the sake of them, the future of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSure enough, our Party is blessed with young people, the greatest of blessings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Party Central Committee highly appreciates our trustworthy young people, who have proved through their painstaking efforts and self-sacrificing struggle that our Party's determination immediately means a reality and materialization, and demonstrated to the whole world the might of the young vanguard in the Songun era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAvailing myself of this meaningful opportunity, I extend to all the builders including the members of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade and the service personnel of the People's Army, who have performed great feats of labour in the building of the power station, warm thanks and militant greetings in the name of the Workers' Party of Korea and together with the blessing of General Kim Jong Il who valued young people and gave prominence to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs I am attending this inauguration ceremony of the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station today, I feel a yearning desire to see General Kim Jong Il. It seems to me that he is bestowing warm praise on us from the faraway Kumsusan Palace of the Sun for our laudable deed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station is associated with his ardent love for young people who represent the future of the country, a proud structure demonstrating the might of our Party's policy of attaching importance to young people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was steadfast in his revolutionary faith that there is nothing in the world that we cannot achieve if we enlist the strength of young people who are dependable successors to the revolution and the most vigorous of social forces. As he trusted them so much, he charged the youth league with the entire project of building the power station. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said on several occasions that he could have the People's Army or the Cabinet take charge of the project but he decided to entrust our young people with the whole of it, because the youth league is a powerful combat unit that implements our Party's plans unconditionally and, more importantly, because he intended to educate and train them in the course of carrying out the project. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe saw to it that the shock brigade was named in a meaningful way in reflection of the aspirations of our young people who would faithfully support the Party's cause looking up to Mt Paektu, the sacred mountain of revolution. He also resolved all the problems arising in building the power station, even ordering a special plane to carry padded coats for the members of the shock brigade. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was seriously ill in the closing years of his revolutionary career, but on his return from a foreign trip, he visited the construction site of the power station in the rugged mountains before dealing with important Party and State affairs. He spoke highly of the young people for having made notable progress in the project and inspired them to perform new heroic exploits. It is very moving to tell about our General's painstaking efforts of patriotic devotion that permeate every nook and cranny of the power station. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station has been built as a grand monument by young people to mark the 70th anniversary of Party founding, shows how sagacious the leadership of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and our Party has been in preparing them to be stalwart successors to the revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo review the course of building the power station, the Party is most pleased about the fact that our young people have armed themselves with one ideology and achieved more solid unity as intended by the great General, rather than the construction of the dams and the possibility of easing the strain on electric power in the Mt Paektu area. This is most important, and it is the greatest achievement to us. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fierce ten-odd-year struggle with nature has produced many young heroes of our era, the young hard core, who are determined to death-defyingly defend the Party with revolutionary faith, sharing destiny with its Central Committee. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs they have cultivated themselves mentally and physically with the clean water and air of Paektu and tempered their courage and faith in the blizzards of Paektu, our young vanguard are the most dependable successors to our Party and reliable pillars of our socialist country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder the Party's trust and affection this large contingent of warriors with a strong sense of organization and discipline and enthusiasm for the revolution and struggle has been trained to carry forward the revolutionary cause of Juche?this is a great victory that cannot be compared to obtaining millions of kilowatts of electricity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs we have such an army of young people, our Party is powerful and our country is widely recognized as a youthful power without parallel in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the course of building the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station have been created the charging spirit and culture of young people that are representative of the Songun era, which constitute a precious asset for the promotion of the youth movement in our country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe charging spirit of young people in the Songun era created at the site of this grandiose nature-remaking project, where Mt Paektu, the sacred mountain on which the Korean revolution was pioneered, is within a calling distance, is a spirit of rushing straight forward after pushing aside other things in hearty response to the Party's call, a powerful attacking spirit of levelling a mountain and blocking a river course at a stroke like exploding dynamite, and a spirit of self-reliance and self-development of tiding over indescribable difficulties by dint of comradeship and the might of the collective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Songun-based culture of our young people is a wholesome culture of developing our decent things, not adopting gaudy ones of others, a militant culture of advancing full of vigour singing revolutionary songs loudly in the face of difficulties, and a typical socialist cultured way of leading an assiduous, meticulous and cultured life whatever the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the ranks of young people across the country brim over with this spirit and culture, as pure as the limpid water of Lake Chon and as straight as the larches on Paektu, the might of the youthful Paektusan power will grow ever stronger. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is why our Party intends to erect here a monument to the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade members and exhibition hall of their feats so as to hand down their achievements to posterity and have all the people who are on study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in the Mt Paektu area learn on the spot from the spirit and culture of the young people of Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe inauguration of the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station powerfully demonstrates to the whole world the greatness of our Party that has provided a brilliant solution to the problem of education of young people, the most difficult problem in the revolution and construction, and established a youthful power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCheers for the idea of attaching importance to young people resounding far and wide in this meaningful October will be a roaring thunder over the enemy who are scheming to pull down our socialism by degenerating and benumbing young people and a loud gun report signalling a fresh spur to the all-people general advance for final victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the unshakeable determination and will of our Party to put forward young people in the vanguard of the ranks of the general onward march as masters of the times and help them put up the doorplate of a thriving country before anybody else.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the Party Central Committee firmly believes in them as reliable comrades-in-arms, who will advance shoulder to shoulder with it in the effort to shape a beautiful future of our country, our motherland. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur Party, believing in the inexhaustible strength of millions of young people, has unfolded a bright blueprint to beat the world, and they are duly in the central position in executing all the operations worked out by the Party Central Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Party's leadership is the lifeline of the youth movement of Korea, and the might of the large contingent of young people is guaranteed by the Party's leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the young people should always advance vigorously, straight forward following the Party with unstained loyalty and conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Let us rush forward along the course of the Korean revolution sailing with the blizzards of Paektu!\"?this is a slogan of trust advanced by our Party. This militant slogan should be upheld everywhere young people live and work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe whole country will become astir when young people are in high spirits, and a prosperous future will be brought earlier when their steps are faster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur great country making a leap forward with youthful vigour is calling our young people to theatres of building a thriving nation where fresh feats are to be created.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYoung people should turn out in high spirits in the sacred struggle to translate the Party's plans and determination into reality and set up structures named after youth in various places, so as not to regret having failed to add brilliance to their youth, the only precious period in their life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen young, one should cherish a great ambition and enterprising spirit to present world-startling research result or to work at the speed of a supersonic plane.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll young people should launch dynamic movements of youth shock brigade, young guards, youth workteam and youth subworkteam at every theatre of the revolutionary struggle so as to make youthful vigour pervade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA vigorous campaign should be waged across society to emulate the charging spirit of the young people in the Songun era and their culture created in the Paektu area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe undertaking to follow the examples of the Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade members is a wide-scale ideological offensive to bring about a turn in the education of young people and freshen the atmosphere of our society as demanded by the developing reality and to resolutely thwart the imperialists' moves for ideological and cultural infiltration and defend our ideology, our spirit and our culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the working people of the country, not to say the rising generation, should keep in mind how the shock brigade members created the legendary tale of heroic youth and how invaluable the patriotic sweat and blood they shed in the days of working against all odds, and live and struggle the way the young people of Paektu did.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Party's information network and mass media should give wide publicity to the ideological and spiritual world, fighting mettle, assiduous work style and revolutionary optimism of the shock brigade members, and make the whole country seethe with enthusiasm for learning from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBearing in mind that developing the youth movement is most important in strengthening the Party and the State and it is a strategic demand of the revolution, Party and youth league organizations at all levels should bring up young people into a reserve force, advance group and wing of our Party and thereby add eternal brilliance to its exploits in building a youthful power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImmovable is our Party's determination to ensure that cheers for the victory of building a thriving country ring out first in the Paektu area where the Juche revolution originated and which is the spiritual mainstay of our people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Paektusan Hero Youth Shock Brigade members and all other builders should harden their resolve to build on their already-gained successes and make continuous offensive, continuous advance and continuous innovations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith firm belief in our heroic young people the Party Central Committee orders them to finish the project of building Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station No. 3 unconditionally by next Youth Day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd they should take the lead in speeding up the laying of broad-gauge railway lines between Hyesan and Samjiyon, sprucing up Samjiyon County as befits the cradle of the Korean revolution and building Ryanggang Province as a model unit for other provinces to follow in potato farming and all other economic affairs and in improving the people's living standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us all dash forward towards a bright future, the Party Central Committee believing in young people and they believing in it on the worthwhile onward march to achieve the prosperity of our country, our motherland, a precious inheritance of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il associated with their lifelong struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe painstaking efforts of patriotic loyalty made by the young people in the Paektu area will live for ever in the memory of our Party, our motherland and our people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGlory to the young vanguard unfailingly loyal to our Party, masters of the dignified youthful Paektusan nation!"

            "content": "Kim Jong Un pronuncia discurso en ceremonia inaugural de Central Hidroelectrica Paektusan\r\nPyongyang, 4 de octubre (ACNC) -- El Mariscal Kim Jong Un, Primer Secretario del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, Primer Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea, pronuncio un discurso en la ceremonia inaugural de la Central Hidroelectrica Heroe Juventud Paektusan.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl texto completo del discurso va como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFidedignos jovenes vanguardias,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy nosotros proclamamos ante el mundo la inauguracion de la Central Hidroelectrica Heroe Juventud Paektusan en medio de las calurosas felicitaciones de todo el ejercito y otros sectores del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa majestuosa construccion de la planta que asemeja el indoblegable temple de los jovenes de la era del Songun (prioridad de los asuntos militares ?N.T.), simpatizantes de nuestro gran Partido, constituye un magno evento que hace mas significativo el septuagesimo aniversario de la fundacion del glorioso Partido del Trabajo de Corea, asi como todo un acontecimiento que vaticina el luminoso porvenir de nuestro prestigioso Estado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAqui, al pie del monte Paektu, donde se ha creado el mito de la juventud heroica durante la construccion de la central, nuestros fidedignos jovenes han sabido corresponder excelentemente a la esperanza del Comite Central del Partido al erigir para la envidia del mundo un gran monumento de la juventud, en un noble acto de patriotismo y lealtad y con la plena disposicion de cumplir las tareas a toda costa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fiel acato al llamamiento combativo del Partido de levantar la Central antes del aniversario 70 de la fundacion del Partido, como magnifico monumento de la juventud, nuestros jovenes dejaron en este suelo del Paektu las huellas de las proezas mas descollantes en la historia del movimiento de la juventud coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVanguardias de nuestro Partido, los miembros de la Brigada de Choque de Jovenes Heroes Paektusan consagraron sin vacilacion su inapreciable vigor y entusiasmo a la construccion de una presa perdurable, ano tras ano y en este paraje escarpado y recondito situado a miles de ries de Pyongyang, la capital.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInenarrables son las hazanas laborales de los integrantes de la brigada quienes, durante varios anos y expuestos al penetrante frio septentrional, rompieron capas pedregosas con martillos y barrenas y removieron las elevaciones para construir la presa y avanzar paso a paso en la obra del desague.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCualquiera se quitaria el sombrero ante esa muestra del espiritu revolucionario, entrega total y patriotismo de los jovenes constructores de la central, incluidos los de la brigada quienes en medio del frio glacial que imposibilitaba la marcha de los camiones los sustituian por trineos para asegurar el transporte, y los del peloton suicida quienes para sostener los rieles se lanzaron al gelido agua del rio Sodu y se convirtieron en “columnas de hielo”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, concluyeron la construccion de la presa para la Central No.1, tras una campana sin tregua de 120 dias en la que, con el valor y coraje que les infundiera el Partido, cumplieron tareas ingentes equivalentes a las que antes habian realizado durante un decenio. Esto deviene un fruto de la lealtad y la consagracion patriotica de los jovenes del Paektu y demas constructores quienes se han movilizado al unisono con el proposito de engalanar con brillantes exitos laborales la historia del Partido de la edificacion de una potencia de la juventud, asi como un mito de la juventud heroica que solamente pueden protagonizar los jovenes coreanos, criados y educados en el regazo del Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante la obra de la presa para la Central No.1 nuestros jovenes han crecido como heroes de la epoca y creadores gigantes y han confirmado con hechos reales la justeza de la politica del Partido de aprecio de la juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa presa de gran altura que contemplamos representa el cumulo de actos de fervoroso patriotismo y fidelidad de nuestros jovenes vanguardias. Y su altura equivale a la de la dignidad de nuestra patria, potencia de la juventud, que tiene muchos jovenes heroes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl estilo de trabajo de los militares y miembros de la brigada quienes, si bien estan muy ocupados por la construccion de la central, se han ofrecido para construir pintorescas aldeas socialistas para quienes habitaban la region inundada y convertir los contornos de la central en bosques y zonas verdes, refleja al pie de la letra el noble mundo espiritual de nuestros jovenes leales quienes materializan a todo trance todas las medidas politicas del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todas las obras monumentales del pais estan impregnadas las hazanas heroicas de los jovenes y muchas de ellas llevan el nombre de “juventud”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este mundo no hay jovenes tan excelentes como los nuestros, quienes en lugar de pasear por las centelleantes calles urbanas acuden a las remotas regiones montanosas para realizar el proposito del Partido y encuentran en ello el orgullo del vivir, y quienes elaboran por si mismos el plan de estudio de la “Universidad Juventud del Paektu” y se preparan como revolucionarios dandole la puntuacion a su conciencia cada dia y a cada momento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe sentido gratitud y ganas de llorar de emocion por el loable esfuerzo de los miembros de la brigada y he tenido el irresistible deseo de ensalzar altamente a todos ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que nuestra revolucion enfrenta pruebas y dificultades, me sostienen como pilar espiritual los jovenes quienes acudieron voluntariamente al lugar de construccion de esta Central donde comenzaron una nueva vida, dieron la primera palada y consagraron su alma patriotica, convirtiendose finalmente en graduados de la Universidad Juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActualmente, el asunto juvenil se presenta como el mayor problema en los focos candentes y las regiones de conflicto en el mundo, pero nuestros jovenes constituyen para nuestro Partido puntales espirituales e inconmovibles puntos de apoyo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiempre que pienso en nuestros jovenes quienes realizaron hazanas heroicas en la construccion de esta central efectuada en pesimas condiciones a diferencia de otras obras, reafirmo la ferrea voluntad de hacer la revolucion hasta el fin para la juventud y el futuro de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe cierto, nuestro Partido tiene la gran suerte de contar con una excelente juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl CC del Partido aprecia altamente a nuestros fidedignos jovenes quienes con su tesonero y abnegado esfuerzo han comprobado que lo que se propone nuestro Partido se hace realidad y se pone en practica y han mostrado ante el mundo el temple de la vanguardia juvenil de la epoca del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovecho esta ocasion significativa para extender, en nombre del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y en lugar de nuestro General quien apreciaba a los jovenes como perla, mi sincero agradecimiento y saludos militantes a los miembros de la Brigada de Choque de Jovenes Heroes Paektusan, los militares del Ejercito Popular y demas constructores quienes realizaron grandes hazanas laborales en la construccion de la central.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAqui en la ceremonia inaugural de la central se me hace mas intensa la anoranza al General Kim Jong Il quien en el Palacio del Sol Kumsusan nos estara felicitando por nuestras acciones laudables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa central es una digna creacion que manifiesta patentemente el poderio de la politica de nuestro Partido de aprecio a la juventud, sintesis del fervoroso amor del gran General a la juventud y el porvenir.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA partir de su invariable credo de que no habia nada irrealizable en este mundo si se lograba movilizar a la juventud, fidedigna continuadora de la revolucion y fuerza mas vigorosa de la sociedad, el General depositaba plena confianza en nuestros jovenes y les encargo exclusivamente a ellos la obra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn mas de una ocasion dijo que asigno esa tarea a la Juventud y no al Ejercito Popular ni al Consejo de Ministros, con el conocimiento de que la Juventud es una organizacion potente que materializa incondicionalmente el proyecto de nuestro Partido y, mas importante aun, con la intencion de educar y forjar a los jovenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn reflejo de la disposicion de los jovenes que con la mirada puesta en el Paektu, monte sagrado de la revolucion, siguen fieles la causa del Partido, dispuso poner a la brigada un significativo nombre, resolvio todos los problemas referentes a la construccion de la central e incluso sugirio enviar en un avion especial abrigos enguatados, portadores de su amor, a los miembros de la brigada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos momentos de su vida hizo una visita al extranjero aunque se sentia mal y a su regreso dejo para mas tarde todos los quehaceres importantes del Partido y Estado, para acudir primero a la obra de la Central en un lugar abrupto, donde evaluo altamente los exitos de los jovenes y los convoco a realizar nuevos meritos heroicos. Su conmovedora abnegacion patriotica se percibe en todos los rincones de la central.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa inauguracion de esta como gran monumento de la juventud en homenaje al 70 aniversario de la fundacion del Partido pone de manifiesto la acertada direccion de nuestros grandes lideres y Partido, formadores de los jovenes como fidedignos continuadores de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe la construccion de la Central lo que mas le alegra al Partido es, mas que la conclusion de la obra de la presa o la posibilidad de solventar la escasez de la electricidad en la zona del monte Paektu, el hecho de que en ese proceso nuestros jovenes se hayan armado con una sola idea y unido mas compactamente, tal y como deseaba el General. Esto es lo mas importante y nuestro mayor exito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el arduo enfrentamiento con la naturaleza que ha durado mas de 10 anos han surgido muchos jovenes heroes y nucleos de nuestra epoca que, dispuestos a correr la misma suerte que el Comite Central del Partido y con la inconmovible fe en la revolucion, defienden a ultranza al partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes vanguardias que se han forjado fisica y espiritualmente tomando el agua diafano y respirando el aire puro del Paektu, y se han dotado del coraje y conviccion expuestos al viento cortante del Paektu, son los mas fidedignos sucesores de nuestro Partido y firmes puntales que sostienen a nuestra patria socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa constitucion de un gran destacamento de titanes fieles a la causa del Juche merced a la confianza y el amor del Partido, quienes organizados y disciplinados arden de pasion por la revolucion y la lucha, constituye una gran victoria incomparable con la obtencion de millones de kilovatios hora de electricidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor tener este gran destacamento, nuestro Partido se hace fuerte y nuestro pais se enorgullece de su condicion de potencia de la juventud, unica de su tipo en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el proceso de la construccion de la central se han creado el espiritu arremetedor y la cultura juveniles de la era del Songun, inapreciables tesoros del movimiento juvenil del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCreado en esta gran batalla de geotransformacion a poca distancia del Paektu, monte sagrado donde se inicio la revolucion coreana, el espiritu arremetedor consiste en correr recto en plena respuesta al llamamiento del Partido dejando en el segundo plano sus quehaceres personales, en remover montes y cortar rios de un golpe, con una fuerza explosiva, y en superar la prueba en las peores condiciones, valiendose del companerismo y colectivismo y haciendose mas fuerte con sus propios recursos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cultura juvenil del Songun es una cultura sana que desarrolla nuestras cosas nobles y no las ajenas de apariencia atractiva, una cultura combativa que permite avanzar llenos de vigor entonando canciones revolucionarias aun en medio de dificultades y un modelo de la cultura socialista de la epoca del Songun que coadyuva a vivir con cuidado y esmero y de manera culta bajo cualquier circunstancia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi tal espiritu y cultura, tan diafanos como el agua cristalina del lago Chon y tan robustos como el alerce del monte Paektu, rigen todos los jovenes del pais, el poderio de la potencia de la juventud Paektusan se multiplicaria cien veces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ahi que nuestro Partido se ha propuesto levantar aqui un monumento y un museo dedicados a las proezas de los miembros de la brigada de choque, en un intento de transmitirlas a la posteridad y educar a los visitantes a los antiguos campos de batalla en la region del monte Paektu en el espiritu y la cultura de aquellos jovenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa inauguracion de la central ha puesto de manifiesto la grandeza de nuestro Partido que ha resuelto con exito el problema de la educacion de los jovenes, uno de los mayores problemas en el proceso de la revolucion y la construccion, y ha levantado una potencia de la juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas clamorosas vivas que dan a nuestra politica de conceder importancia a la juventud y que retumban bajo el cielo del significativo mes de octubre frustraran cual trueno aterrador la intentona del enemigo de desmoronar nuestro regimen socialista mediante la corrupcion y degradacion de la juventud, asi como aceleraran cual disparo de una pistola de salida la marcha general de todo el pueblo hacia la victoria final.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsiderar a los jovenes como protagonistas de la epoca y situarlos a la vanguardia de la marcha general para que sean los primeros en abrir la puerta de un Estado poderoso y prospero es la firme decision y voluntad de nuestro Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comite Central del Partido confia plenamente en los jovenes como companeros de armas en la lucha por un futuro hermoso de nuestro pais, nuestra patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConfiando en la fuerza inagotable de millones de jovenes, nuestro Partido elabora el grandioso plan de superar a otras naciones y los coloca en un puesto nada desdenable al centro de todas las operaciones de su Comite Central.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa direccion del Partido le da la vida al movimiento de la juventud coreana y con ella esta se vuelve mas poderosa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los jovenes, con la fidelidad tan inmaculada como el diamante y la conciencia limpia, avanzaran recto y con vigor, siguiendo para siempre al Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!A toda vela en direccion a la que sopla el viento cortante del Paektu siguiendo la ruta indicada por la revolucion coreana!, esta es la consigna de confianza y de lucha lanzada por el Partido, que debe regir la vida social y laboral de todos los jovenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi estos se animan, lo imitara todo el pais y cuanto mas rapido sea su avance tanto mas poderosa y prospera sera la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra gran patria que, pletorica de la juventud, da saltos vertiginosos, convoca a los jovenes a realizar nuevas hazanas en la construccion de un Estado poderoso y prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos, al incorporarse decididamente a la sagrada tarea para hacer realidad el proyecto y la decision del Partido, levantaran por doquier las creaciones que llevaran el nombre de la juventud y pasaran sin ningun arrepentimiento sus preciosos anos que jamas volveran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCualquiera que sea joven debe poseer gran ambicion y espiritu emprendedor: presentar trabajos investigativos que sorprendan al mundo por tratar la tecnologia de punta y realizar cualquier tarea con la velocidad supersonica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los jovenes desarrollaran con audacia los movimientos de brigada de choque, de vanguardia, de equipo de trabajo y de cuadrilla juveniles en todos los escenarios de la lucha revolucionaria de modo que todos esos lugares se animen con su presencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToda la sociedad debe impulsar dinamicamente la labor encaminada a aprender del espiritu arremetedor y de la cultura juvenil de la epoca del Songun, creados en la zona del Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeguir el ejemplo de los miembros de la brigada de Jovenes Heroes Paektusan constituye una ofensiva ideologica dirigida a registrar un cambio en la educacion a los jovenes de acuerdo a la realidad en desarrollo y renovar el ambiente de la sociedad, asi como una gran batalla ideologica para frustrar resueltamente las maquinaciones de penetracion cultural e ideologica de los imperialistas y proteger nuestra ideologia, espiritu y cultura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario que tanto la nueva generacion como los trabajadores de todo el pais conozcan bien como los miembros de la brigada crearon la leyenda de la juventud heroica y cuan precioso era el sudor que derramaron en los momentos mas criticos en aras de la patria, para asi vivir y luchar al igual que los jovenes del Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario divulgar ampliamente mediante la red de propaganda del Partido y la prensa el mundo ideologico-espiritual, el estilo de lucha, la esmerada manera de trabajar y el optimismo revolucionario de los miembros de la brigada, para que todo el pais se anime a aprender de ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBien concientes de que el fortalecimiento del movimiento juvenil adquiere suma importancia para la consolidacion del Partido y el Estado, las organizaciones del partido y de la Union de la Juventud a distintos niveles deben formar a los jovenes como reservas, patrullas y flancos del Partido y asi perpetuar el merito de nuestro Partido de haber levantado una potencia de la juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs invariable la decision de nuestro Partido de hacer resonar los vitores a la victoria en la construccion de un Estado poderoso y prospero primero en la region del Paektu, pilar espiritual de nuestro pueblo, donde echo raices la revolucion del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos miembros de la brigada y todos los demas constructores se predispondran a continuar el ataque, el avance y la innovacion a base de los exitos ya alcanzados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comite Central del Partido, partiendo de su plena confianza en los jovenes heroes, les ordena terminar sin falta la construccion de la Central Hidroelectrica No. 3 Juventud Heroe Paektusan antes del Dia de la Juventud del ano siguiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos jovenes deben ser, ademas, los primeros en acelerar el tendido de vias ferreas anchas en el tramo Hyesan-Samjiyon, acondicionar mejor el distrito de Samjiyon, cuna de la revolucion coreana, y crear el ejemplo del pais en el cultivo de papas y demas labores economicas de la provincia de Ryanggang y el mejoramiento de la vida de su poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sagrada marcha hacia la prosperidad de nuestro pais, nuestra patria, valiosa herencia que nos dejaron los grandes lideres, el Comite Central del Partido confiara en la juventud y viceversa, y avanzaremos vigorosamente hacia un futuro esplendido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Partido, la patria y el pueblo rememoraran para siempre a los jovenes que derramaron el sudor de patriotismo y lealtad en la region del Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Gloria a los protagonistas de la prestigiosa potencia de la juventud Paektusan, jovenes vanguardias infinitamente fieles al Partido!"
