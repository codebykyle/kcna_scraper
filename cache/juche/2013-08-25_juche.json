            "content": "Kim Jong Un Publishes Talk on Day of Songun\r\n Pyongyang August 25 (KCNA) -- Supreme leader Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, published a talk \"Let Us Add Eternal Brilliance to Comrade Kim Jong Il's Great Idea and Achievements of the Songun Revolution\" to the WPK's Organ Rodong Sinmun and the KPA's Organ Joson Inmingun on Sunday, the Day of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t The following is its full text:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With deep respect for the great Comrade Kim Jong Il and firm confidence in the victory of the revolution, our service personnel and people greet the 53rd anniversary of the start of his leadership of the Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Day of Songun, when General Kim Jong Il started his leadership of the Songun revolution, is, together with the day of the founding of the KPA (Korean People's Army), a historic day when an important milestone was set up for the history of building up our revolutionary armed forces and the history of our country. As there was this significant day, a historic turn could be brought about in developing our revolutionary armed forces and implementing the cause of the Juche revolution, and the history and traditions of our sacred Songun revolution that had been pioneered and developed by force of arms, achieving victory, could be carried forward continuously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun is a proud tradition of the Korean revolution which was pioneered by Comrade Kim Il Sung and led by him and Comrade Kim Jong Il and the banner of victory and glory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great Generalissimos blazed the trail of the Songun revolution for the first time in history, thus creating a new history of Songun and ushering in the era of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having clarified in his early days the truth of the revolutionary struggle that one can emerge victorious against an armed enemy only when one fights him with arms and advanced the idea and line of attaching importance to arms, to military affairs, the great Comrade Kim Il Sung regarded building armed forces as a fundamental problem in the revolution, directed primary efforts to organizing and developing the armed ranks and achieved the historic cause of national liberation with the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army as the main force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By relying on the arms of the revolution, he wisely led two revolutionary wars, two stages of social revolution and socialist construction, and thus built on this land socialism of our style centred on the masses of the people and demonstrated the dignity and honour of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comrade Kim Jong Il, who was faithful to Comrade Kim Il Sung's ideas and cause, led our revolution along the glorious road of victory, braving the severe trials and adversities of history by dint of his unique leadership of the Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His visit to Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division of the KPA on August 25, 1960 was a historic event that proclaimed his succession of the cause of the Songun revolution and the start of his Songun-based leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun was the General's revolutionary idea, his practice in the revolution, his political ideal and his political mode.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the long period spanning more than half a century from the day when he started his leadership of the Songun revolution, the great General visited one KPA unit after another, strengthening the army to be an invincible revolutionary army, and victoriously led the revolution and construction by force of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regarding the strengthening of the KPA as the most important of affairs in the Songun revolution, he raised the KPA as the buttress, the main force, of our revolution and achieved the historic victory in the grim anti-imperialist, anti-US showdown in defence of the country's security and socialism by training the KPA to be the army of the leader boundlessly faithful to the cause of the WPK (Workers' Party of Korea), to be an invincible revolutionary army. He defined the spirit of defending the leader unto death, the spirit of implementing his instructions at any cost and the self-sacrificing spirit displayed by the service personnel as a revolutionary spirit symbolic and representative of the Songun era, as the revolutionary soldier spirit, and led all the service personnel and people to live and struggle in that spirit, thus ensuring that a great turn and changes were brought about in all sectors of the revolution and construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to consolidate the successes of his Songun-based leadership and administer Songun politics in a comprehensive way, he saw to it that the First Session of the Tenth Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea adopted the Socialist Constitution that embodies the idea and principles of the Songun revolution and established a new state administration structure, whose backbone is the National Defence Commission, and led all state affairs to be conducted on the principle of giving precedence to military affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of his leadership of the Songun revolution is an unprecedented history of thoroughgoing anti-imperialist independence, a history of infinite patriotic devotion; it is also a history of ennobling trust and affection, filled with absolute trust in and maternal affection for the service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As there was the General's leadership of the Songun revolution, our revolution could win victory after victory surmounting all manner of vicissitudes of history; as there was the General's super-intense forced march of patriotic devotion, our service personnel and people could work historic miracles unknown to mankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun was, indeed, our General's immutable revolutionary creed, which he cherished and applied all his life, and a great revolutionary practice, during which he adorned the history of the country with brilliant victories and imperishable achievements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the course of leading the unprecedented Songun revolution, the General formulated and developed the idea of the Songun revolution, and thus created a guiding principle and ever-victorious banner our people and the revolutionary peoples of the world should adhere to in accomplishing the cause of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea of the Songun revolution is an idea of giving importance and precedence to military affairs in implementing the masses' cause of independence, the socialist cause, and pushing ahead with the overall revolution and construction with the revolutionary army as the core force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With its starting point being the Juche-based revolutionary principle that the victory of the revolutionary cause is decided by arms of the revolution, the idea gives scientific and practical answers to the key questions arising in winning victory in the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It clarifies the revolutionary theory on building up the arms of the revolution, the revolutionary army, strengthening the driving force of the revolution with the revolutionary army as the core and, by relying on it, advancing the revolution and construction victoriously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its most important requirement is that the army should be developed into the army of the Party and the leader, into an invincible revolutionary army capable of defeating any formidable enemy, with importance being attached to military affairs and primary efforts directed to building up the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order for the masses to carve out their destiny and accomplish the cause of socialism amid sharp confrontation with the imperialists and constant danger of war, they must, before anything else, firmly hold up and strengthen the arms of the revolution. It is a serious lesson taught by the history of the world socialist movement that when the arms of the revolution are weak or waver, they can defend neither the destiny of the masses nor socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That one must consolidate the driving force of the revolution with the revolutionary army as the main force and propel the revolutionary struggle and construction work by relying on its leading role is a new revolutionary theory elucidated by the Songun idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolution is a do-or-die struggle of deciding who prevails over whom between the revolutionary forces and the counterrevolutionary forces, so the destiny of the revolution depends on how the driving force of the revolution is strengthened and how its role is enhanced.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among the social groups that form the revolutionary forces in a socialist society, whose masters are the masses, the group that is the strongest in the revolutionary sense, organized aspect, discipline and fighting capabilities is the revolutionary army under the guidance of the leader. The revolutionary army, for its revolutionary idea, great spiritual strength and revolutionary temperament, is capable of leading the overall society and propelling the revolutionary struggle and construction work. If the revolutionary army stands in the van and all the people struggle with the revolutionary spirit and temperament of the army by forming an integrated whole with the service personnel, their power is incomparably great.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By the idea of the Songun revolution, a new road, a road to victory, was opened for successfully advancing the masses' cause of independence, the socialist cause, by consolidating the driving force of the revolution and enhancing its role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General's idea of the Songun revolution throws a fresh light on the political theory that Songun politics is the most powerful mode of politics and the basic mode of socialist politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ideas and ideals are translated into practice by politics, which is a factor that decides the destiny of the masses and the rise and fall of a country and nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great General elucidated for the first time in history that socialist politics for fully realizing the independent demands and interests of the masses should be Songun politics that gives importance and precedence to military affairs, and formulated Songun politics as the basic mode of socialist politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As he said, Songun politics is a mode of socialist politics that raises military affairs as the most important of all state affairs and defends the country, revolution and socialism and accelerates the overall socialist construction with the KPA as the core, as the main force. It is a mode of independent politics that fully embodies the fundamentals and principles of the Songun idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Formulation of Songun politics as the basic mode of socialist politics has brought about a fundamental change in the history of mankind's politics and the history of socialist politics and presented a treasured sword with which to successfully realize the ideals and principles of socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General's Songun idea is a revolutionary idea and theory which embodies a thoroughgoing anti-imperialist, independent stand and the spirit of ennobling love of the country, nation and people and which is based on an iron faith and willpower.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun, a new term in our era, was coined reflecting the unshakeable faith, willpower and great pluck of Comrade Kim Jong Il who, taking full responsibility for the destiny and future of the country and people amid long-drawn-out, sharp confrontation with an imperialist power, solved all problems in our own way and in conformity with the demands and interests of our people and nation.   As we have the idea of the Songun revolution, a great idea of Comrade Kim Jong Il, we have been able to defend the dignity of the country, independence of the people and gains of socialism with credit and open the way for the prosperity of the country and rosy future of the nation by our own strength, that is, by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As an idea enriched and developed in the course of the practical struggle to apply the Juche idea, the Songun idea is a scientific revolutionary theory which makes it possible to satisfy the requirements of the Juche idea in a perfect and comprehensive way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The formulation and development of the idea and theory of the Songun revolution by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il further enriched the ideological and theoretical treasure-house of our revolution and greatly increased the appeal and vitality of the Juche idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche idea is the roots of the Songun idea and the latter is a brilliant embodiment of the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the Songun idea, the Juche idea could be splendidly applied to the revolutionary practice, shining more brightly as a great guiding ideology which guarantees the victorious advance and accomplishment of the masses' cause of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General performed undying exploits for the country and revolution, for the times and history with his outstanding leadership of the Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He safeguarded with honour the Juche-oriented socialism, which Comrade Kim Il Sung established, and assured the solid continuity of the revolutionary cause of Juche, the revolutionary cause of Songun, by dint of his leadership of the Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-oriented socialism is a precious gain of our revolution Comrade Kim Il Sung achieved devoting his life, and it is our people's lifeblood and the cradle of their true life and happiness. The 90s of the last century, when the reckless anti-DPRK moves of the allied forces of the US and other imperialists to check the victorious advance of our revolution and stamp out our socialism went to extremes, was a period of the severest ordeals for our revolution. When our army and people were at the crossroads whether they would remain an independent people and guards to become victors or be reduced to the imperialists' colonial slaves again, Comrade Kim Jong Il determinedly held up the banner of Songun, and defended the Juche-oriented socialism with honour and achieved brilliant victories. This was a miracle of history which only our General could bring about.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By dint of his leadership of the Songun revolution he laid a firm foundation for the prosperity of the country and the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche and provided a sure guarantee for victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most important guarantee for victory in the revolution is to strengthen the party, the General Staff of the revolution, and solidify the driving force of the revolution by uniting the service personnel and people around it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A fundamental principle which the great General consistently adhered to in the building of our Party was to build it into the party of the leader. He defined imbuing the entire Party with Kimilsungism as the ultimate objective of its building and wisely led the effort for firmly establishing a monolithic ideological system and a monolithic leadership system across the Party. As a result, our Party could be developed into a revolutionary party which is unfailingly faithful to the ideology and guidance of its leader and possessed of a strong sense of organization and discipline and into an ever-victorious party with solid mass and military bases, and could discharge its mission and role as the guiding force in implementing the cause of the Songun revolution. The General held up single-hearted unity as the greatest foundation of the revolution and perfectly realized the single-hearted unity of the Party, army and people centred on the leader, thus strengthening the driving forc\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t e of the Songun revolution remarkably.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By strengthening the KPA to be an invincible army and consolidating the military capabilities of the country to the maximum with the KPA as the core, he provided a sure military guarantee for the victory of the cause of the Juche revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under his energetic guidance, the KPA developed into a vanguard detachment which regards defending the leader unto death as its lifeblood and takes the lead in implementing the orders of its Supreme Commander at all costs, and into a trailblazer in the struggle to accomplish the cause of the Songun revolution. A forceful drive was waged to make the defence industry Juche-oriented, modern and informatized, enabling us to produce any sophisticated military equipment as we wish by relying on our own effort and technology.  Thanks to the General's outstanding leadership of the Songun revolution, the KPA could be developed into an invincible revolutionary army, ours could become a country which can make and launch artificial satellites and a nuclear state, fully demonstrating its dignity as the powerful Paektusan nation, and we could reliably defend the dignity of the country and the sovereignty of the nation, frustrating the imperialist moves of aggression and challenges at ever\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t y step.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great General laid firm material and technological foundations for the building of a thriving socialist country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under his leadership a grand plan for building a prosperous country was unfolded during the days of the Arduous March and forced march, when our revolution was undergoing grim trials, and a hot wind of creating fresh miracles and innovations swept across the country. Fierce flames of the industrial revolution in the new century flared up ushering in the era of the knowledge economy, monumental structures symbolic of the era were built in all parts of the country and model works representative of Songun culture were created in large numbers. What our service personnel and people created in the Songun era under his guidance constitutes a valuable asset for the prosperity of Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim Jong Il's Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great General effected a fresh turn in the struggle for the independent reunification of the country and firmly defended global peace and security on the strength of his leadership of the Songun revolution. He ushered in the June 15 era of reunification by our nation itself, provided a precious asset for the reunification of the country and the common prosperity of the nation and safeguarded peace in Asia and the rest of the world by smashing the imperialists' uninterrupted schemes to unleash a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great exploits Comrade Kim Jong Il performed for the country and revolution, for the times and history for more than half a century by dint of his tireless leadership of the Songun revolution will shine for ever along with the triumphant advance of our revolutionary cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should faithfully carry forward his great idea and achievements of the Songun revolution and add eternal brilliance to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea of the Songun revolution is a great guideline of our revolution and his Songun-based leadership exploits are a motive force for victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakeable faith and unbreakable will of our Party, army and people to carry forward and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, invariably holding aloft the banner of Songun.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should follow to the end the road of Songun, the road of independence and the road of socialism that the great General traversed throughout his life, translate his instructions into brilliant realities and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, the revolutionary cause of Songun, with credit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All officials, Party members and other working people should firmly arm themselves with the General's idea of the Songun revolution, deeply study his great Songun leadership achievements and thoroughly apply and add lustre to them in the revolutionary struggle and construction work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The line of giving importance to arms, to military affairs, should be implemented to the letter for the strengthening of the defence capabilities of the country to be steel-strong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA should be prepared more firmly into an army strong in ideology and faith, a powerful Paektusan revolutionary army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leadership of the Party is the lifeline of the KPA, and its might is inconceivable separated from the leadership of the Party. The general direction ahead of the KPA is one, that is, to advance straight forward with guns levelled in the very direction our Party indicates. Our arms must serve as an ever-lasting cornerstone that ensures a sure guarantee for the Party and its cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The officers and men of the KPA should burn their hearts with a single idea, a single determination, to support only the Party and the leader and safeguard them unto death, whatever ordeals may crop up and however the situation may change. They should equip themselves firmly with the revolutionary ideas of our Party and cherish a steadfast faith that they will defend to the end the red flag of the revolution, the Juche flag of the Party, at the cost of their lives. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should make their training more intensive, as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did on Mt. Paektu, so as to prepare themselves into a-match-for-a-hundred combatants possessed of Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's military strategy and tactics, heroic combat spirit and actual war capability, establish rigid discipline in their units and assume the perfect appearance of a regular army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Military posts and barracks should be laid out as if they were the service personnel's native houses, and satisfactory material and cultural living conditions provided so that they can lead a good service life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While discharging their basic duty of defending the country, the service personnel should make breakthroughs in several sectors and major projects of socialist construction, and never feel contented in doing things for the people but always take the lead in this regard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A great effort should be channeled into developing the defence industry. The sector of the defence industry should concentrate its efforts on making a bigger stride in building our country into an invincible military power, and thus produce more and better-quality military hardware of our own style that are precise, light, unmanned and intelligent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Worker-Peasant Red Guards should enhance their combat capabilities through intensive combat and political training and reliably defend their respective provinces, counties and villages in time of emergency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the sectors of socialist construction should bring about a great leap forward and great innovations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should radically improve the people's standard of living by giving a spur to the building of an economic giant, holding aloft our Party's line of simultaneously promoting the two fronts (economic development and the upbuilding of nuclear forces).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should make innovations in the sectors of agriculture and light industry, major thrust areas in building an economic giant, and promote construction of dwelling houses, so as to ensure that the people lead an affluent and happy life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should concentrate our efforts on the priority sectors of the national economy, the basic industry sectors, to ensure that the existing self-supporting foundations pay off, and vigorously push ahead with the effort for modernizing them and normalizing their production. We should direct a strenuous effort to the electric-power and coal-mining industries in particular, and develop all sectors of the national economy with metallurgical and chemical industries as twin pillars.    \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By rapidly developing science and technology and educating all the people to be well versed in science and technology, we should raise the level of putting the national economy on a modern and CNC basis and perfect the economic structure of the country in keeping with the requirements of the era of the knowledge economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should accelerate the construction of a cultured socialist nation. It is important to make all the members of society become artists and enjoyers of socialist culture and bring about a fresh turn in all the sectors of cultural construction. By doing so, we should translate into reality the people's desire for a wholesome and cultured way of life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to bring about a decisive turn in the construction of a thriving socialist country, the militant functions and role of Party organizations should be further heightened. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Party organizations are the vanguard organizations of the Songun revolution, and the Party's ideology and leadership are implemented through them. They should regard it as the main line of Party work to establish the monolithic leadership system of the Party, and ensure that all officials, Party members and other working people support the leader's ideas and leadership with loyalty and conduct all types of work in line with the Party's ideas and intentions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the current general offensive, Party organizations should give fullest play to the spiritual strength of officials, Party members and other working people. The mother of miracle is the spiritual strength of the masses, and the key to ushering in a new heyday in the building of a thriving nation is to motivate their hearts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Party organizations should scrupulously educate officials, Party members and other working people to learn the greatness of the General's idea and achievements of the Songun revolution and exalt their brilliance. They should intensify the frontline-style political work among the masses so that officials, Party members and other working people make it an element of their living to learn from the spirit of the service personnel of defending the leader and carrying out his instructions unto death and their fighting spirit, and make strenuous efforts to create the Masikryong speed by displaying Kim Jong Il's patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people should propel the grand socialist construction on the strength of joint operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Joint operation between them is a powerful struggling mode of the service personnel and people in waging an unyielding offensive with one mind and purpose. The commanding personnel of the KPA and leading civilian officials should scrupulously organize and command the joint operations and enlist their spiritual strength and all means to perform unfailingly and in time the revolutionary tasks assigned to their respective units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t True to the instructions and lofty will of the great Generalissimos, we should make proactive efforts to open a new phase of national reunification, prevent aggression and war and defend global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea and cause of our Songun revolution are invincible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the great Juche idea and the Songun revolutionary idea illuminate the road ahead of us and there are the wise leadership of the Party, the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people and the invincible KPA, the victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche and the revolutionary cause of Songun is definite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As in the past, so in the future, we will achieve only victory for ever, upholding the great banner of Songun."

Una fecha significativa que produjo cambios historicos en el fortalecimiento y desarrollo de nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias y en el cumplimiento de la causa revolucionaria del Juche y que dio continuidad a la historia y tradicion de nuestra sagrada revolucion de Songun, la cual se ha valido del fusil para su comienzo, avance y exitos consecutivos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSongun es una enorgullecedora tradicion de la revolucion coreana que emprendio el gran companero Kim Il Sung y dirigieron este y Kim Jong Il, asi como la bandera de la victoria y gloria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFueron los grandes Generalisimos quienes exploraron el camino de la revolucion de Songun y escribieron un nuevo capitulo de la historia abriendo la epoca de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Il Sung expuso tempranamente la verdad de la lucha revolucionaria de que solamente con las armas se puede vencer al enemigo armado y presento la idea y el lineamiento que conceden prioridad al fusil y a los asuntos militares. Considero la construccion de las fuerzas armadas como uno de los asuntos fundamentales de la revolucion, presto atencion primordial a organizar y consolidar el cuerpo armado y logro la historica obra de la liberacion nacional, con el Ejercito Revolucionario Popular de Corea como pilar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecurrio al fusil de la revolucion en su sabia direccion de las dos guerras revolucionarias, las dos fases de la revolucion social y la construccion socialista, hasta que levanto el socialismo a nuestro estilo que coloca en su centro a las masas populares y elevo la dignidad y el honor de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiel a su idea y obra, Kim Jong Il supero las duras pruebas de la historia y condujo a nuestra revolucion por el glorioso camino de la victoria, al dirigir a la nacion con el original metodo de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFue el 25 de agosto de 1960 cuando dejo sus primeras huellas de direccion en la Division Guardia de Tanques 105 Seul Ryu Kyong Su, acontecimiento historico que manifesto su decision de continuar la causa revolucionaria del Lider y significo el comienzo de su orientacion mediante Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSongun fue su idea y practica revolucionarias, su ideal y metodo politicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn sus continuos viajes de inspeccion a las unidades del Ejercito Popular durante mas de medio siglo desde que comenzo a dirigir la revolucion mediante Songun, consolido al Ejercito Popular como indestructibles fuerzas armadas revolucionarias y, valiendose de Songun, logro el victorioso avance del proceso revolucionario y constructivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsolidar al ejercito fue para el el quehacer mas importante en la empresa de Songun: al convertirlo en indestructibles tropas revolucionarias del Lider, infinitamente fieles a la causa del Partido, lo enaltecio como pilar y fuerza principal de la revolucion y alcanzo triunfos historicos en los cruentos enfrentamientos con el imperialismo y con Estados Unidos para salvaguardar la seguridad de la patria y el socialismo. Denomino como espiritu revolucionario de los militares, espiritu que simboliza y representa la era de Songun, los rasgos puestos de manifiesto por los soldados del Ejercito Popular, como la disposicion a defender al Lider y cumplir sus ensenanzas al riesgo de la vida y el sacrificio heroico, y encauzo a todos los militares y civiles para que vivieran y lucharan con ese espiritu, registrando con ello un gran auge en todos los dominios de la revolucion y su construccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el objetivo de afianzar los exitos de su orientacion mediante Songun y materializar en todas las esferas la politica de Songun, dispuso que la primera reunion de la Asamblea Popular Suprema de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en su X legislatura adoptara una Constitucion Socialista que reflejara la idea y los principios revolucionarios de Songun. Asimismo establecio un nuevo sistema de administracion estatal que tuviera como eje el Comite de Defensa Nacional y condujo sabiamente para que todas las actividades del Estado se realizaran bajo el principio de la preponderancia militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa inaudita historia de su orientacion de la revolucion mediante Songun se caracteriza por la independencia antiimperialista a carta cabal y abnegacion patriotica sin parangon, por las sublimes muestras de absoluta confianza y amor paternal hacia los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito y otros sectores de la poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a su direccion, nuestra revolucion ha podido cosechar sucesivas victorias contra viento y marea. Gracias a sus superintensas jornadas de trabajo para el bienestar de la nacion, nuestro ejercito y otros sectores de la poblacion han podido engendrar milagros que jamas ha conocido la historia de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe hecho, Songun fue el inconmovible credo revolucionario que nuestro General abrigaba y plasmo en toda su vida, asi como una grandiosa practica revolucionaria mediante la cual engalano la historia nacional con brillantes victorias y sempiternas hazanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl formalizar y enriquecer la idea de Songun en el proceso de su orientacion sin precedentes, les preparo a nuestro pueblo y otros revolucionarios del mundo las directrices y la bandera para sus consecutivos triunfos en su empeno por verificar la causa de la independencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos hablando de una idea que prioriza los asuntos militares en la causa de las masas populares por la independencia y el socialismo y que impulsa todo el proceso revolucionario y constructivo teniendo como nucleo al ejercito revolucionario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa idea parte de un principio de la revolucion sustentado en la idea Juche, consistente en que el fusil de la revolucion decide el triunfo de la causa revolucionaria y responde de manera cientifica y practica a los asuntos clave para la victoria de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnuncia la teoria revolucionaria sobre la necesidad de fortalecer el fusil de la revolucion, el ejercito de la revolucion, consolidar el sujeto de la revolucion tomandolo como nucleo y apoyarse en el para el victorioso avance del proceso revolucionario y constructivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu mayor exigencia es dar importancia a los asuntos militares, prestar atencion primordial a la construccion del ejercito y consolidar al ejercito como el del Partido y el lider, indestructibles fuerzas armadas revolucionarias capaces de derrotar a cualquier enemigo poderoso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara forjar su destino y lograr la causa socialista en medio del intenso enfrentamiento con el imperialismo y del peligro permanente de la guerra, las masas populares deben consolidar ante todo el fusil de la revolucion y empunarlo mas firmemente. La historia del movimiento socialista mundial nos ensena la seria leccion de que con un ejercito debil e inconsecuente no se puede defender el destino de los pueblos ni el socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRobustecer el sujeto de la revolucion tomando al ejercito como fuerza principal y valerse de su papel protagonico para impulsar la lucha revolucionaria y la labor de construccion deviene una nueva teoria revolucionaria dilucidada por la idea de Songun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa revolucion es una lucha a muerte o vida entre revolucionarios y contrarrevolucionarios y su destino depende de como se robustece  el sujeto de la revolucion y se eleva su papel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn ejercito revolucionario dirigido por el lider es el mas revolucionario, organizado, disciplinado y combativo de todos los colectivos sociales que constituyen las fuerzas revolucionarias en una sociedad socialista donde las masas populares son sus duenas. Por su idea, fuerza espiritual y temperamento revolucionarios, es capaz de orientar al conjunto de la sociedad e impulsar la lucha revolucionaria y la labor de construccion. Sus potencialidades se hacen incomparablemente grandes si toma la delantera y, unido monoliticamente con toda la poblacion, lucha con el espiritu y temperamento que lo caracterizan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa idea revolucionaria de Songun ha abierto un nuevo camino, un camino de la victoria que permite consolidar el sujeto de la revolucion y elevar su papel para el exitoso avance de la causa de las masas populares por la independencia y el socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpone por primera vez la teoria de que Songun es la politica mas poderosa y el principal metodo politico del socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa idea y el ideal se hacen realidad a traves de la politica, factor que decide el destino de las masas populares, la prosperidad o la decadencia de un pais y una nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor primera vez en la historia el gran companero Kim Jong Il expuso que, por su objetivo de materializar en todos los aspectos la aspiracion de las masas populares a la independencia y defender sus intereses, la politica socialista debe ser necesariamente Songun y lo formalizo como principal metodo de la politica socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo el senalara, esta politica situa los asuntos militares por encima de todos los demas quehaceres del Estado, defiende a la patria, la revolucion y el socialismo e impulsa con dinamismo la construccion socialista en su conjunto, teniendo al Ejercito Popular como fuerzas medulares y principales. Se trata de un metodo de caracter independiente que encarna integralmente los principios y formulas que emanan de la idea Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el nacimiento de la mencionada politica como metodo principal de politica socialista, se han producido cambios trascendentales en la historia politica de la humanidad y del socialismo y hemos llegado a tener un medio omnipotente para realizar con exito el ideal y los principios de socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa idea Songun del companero Kim Jong Il es un pensamiento revolucionario que se rige por una firme posicion independiente y antimperialista y por el noble amor a la patria, la nacion y el pueblo y que se basa en una ferrea conviccion y voluntad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste termino de la epoca actual nace de la inconmovible fe y voluntad y el gran valor que caracterizaban al companero Kim Jong Il quien, al asumir plena responsabilidad del destino y el futuro de la nacion y el pueblo, resolvio todos los problemas a favor de sus exigencias e intereses y a nuestra manera en medio de un duro y prolongado enfrentamiento con las potencias imperialistas. Su gran idea revolucionaria, Songun, nos permite defender firmemente y con nuestras fuerzas y armas la dignidad del pais, la independencia del pueblo y las conquistas del socialismo y garantiza el fortalecimiento y la prosperidad de la patria y el luminoso futuro de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnriquecida en la lucha para llevar a la practica la idea Juche, es una teoria cientifica y revolucionaria que ayuda materializar impecablemente y en todos los aspectos las exigencias de tal idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a su formalizacion y desarrollo por el companero Kim Jong Il, se ha enriquecido el archivo de pensamientos de nuestra revolucion y han alcanzado niveles desconocidos la fuerza de atraccion y la vitalidad de la idea Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta es la raiz de Songun, su fiel reflejo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs gracias a la idea Songun que la Juche, puesta en la practica revolucionaria, cobra mayor vigencia como gran directriz que garantiza la marcha triunfante y culminacion de la causa de las masas populares por la independencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il condujo con habilidad el proceso revolucionario de Songun, realizando imperecederos meritos para la patria, la revolucion, la epoca y la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefendio con honor el socialismo del Juche establecido por nuestro Lider y aseguro la continuidad de la causa revolucionaria del Juche, la de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl socialismo del Juche es un inapreciable logro de nuestra revolucion que el gran Lider consiguio con el esfuerzo de toda la vida y constituye la vida de nuestro pueblo y la cuna de su verdadera existencia y felicidad. La decada de 1990 fue un periodo muy duro para nuestra revolucion, pues habia llegado a colmo la descabellada intencion del imperialismo estadounidense y sus aliados de detener el avance victorioso de nuestra revolucion y acabar con nuestro socialismo. Cuando los coreanos se encontraban ante el dilema de triunfar como pueblo y combatientes independientes o someterse una vez mas al imperialismo como esclavos coloniales, nuestro General defendio firmemente el socialismo del Juche y logro un brillante triunfo enarbolando en alto la bandera de Songun, un milagro de la historia que no puede ser engendrado por ningun otro ser humano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFue el quien al frente de la revolucion de Songun preparo una solida base para la prosperidad de la patria y la culminacion de la causa revolucionaria del Juche y dio la plena garantia de su triunfo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl requisito mas importante para el triunfo de la revolucion es fortalecer su Estado Mayor que es el partido y agrupar compactamente al ejercito y el pueblo a su alrededor, reforzando asi las fuerzas que protagonizan la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl principio fundamental que nuestro General habia venido manteniendo de manera invariable en la construccion del partido fue lograr que nuestro Partido fuera del Lider Kim Il Sung. Definio la identificacion de todo el Partido con el kimilsungismo como objetivo general de su construccion y condujo con inteligencia la labor encaminada a afianzar el sistema de ideologia y direccion unica en todas sus instancias. Como resultado, nuestro Partido se ha convertido en una invencible agrupacion revolucionaria, infinitamente fiel a la idea y direccion de su Lider, con alto sentido de organizacion y disciplina, con un fuerte arraigo en las masas y el ejercito, y cumple satisfactoriamente su mision y papel como orientador de la revolucion de Songun. Nuestro General logro la unidad monolitica del Partido, el Ejercito y el pueblo en torno al lider, planteandola como la tarea mas importante de la revolucion, y asi multiplico el poderio de las fuerzas impulsoras de la revolucion de \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien hizo invencible al Ejercito Popular y, con este como nucleo, consolido las potencialidades militares del pais, firme garantia para el triunfo de la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo su entusiasta direccion, nuestro Ejercito Popular se ha convertido en un destacamento de la revolucion de Songun que tiene como razon de ser defender al Lider a riesgo de la muerte y cumple infaliblemente las ordenes del Comandante Supremo, tomando siempre la delantera. Adecuar a las condiciones propias del pais, modernizar e informatizar en la industria de defensa nacional se han impulsado a tal grado que hoy podemos producir cualquier armamento moderno que deseemos con nuestros propios recursos. Gracias a la destacada direccion de la revolucion de Songun por nuestro General, el Ejercito Popular ha crecido como una fuerza revolucionaria incomparablemente poderosa, nuestro pais ha hecho gala de su impetu como potencia Paektusan que fabrica y lanza satelites artificiales y posee armas nucleares, y hemos defendido fidedignamente la soberania y dignidad del pais frustrando todas las agresiones y provocaciones de los imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran General asento una firme base material y tecnica para la construccion de un Estado socialista poderoso y prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a el, durante la Marcha Penosa, la Forzada, periodo en que nuestra revolucion pasaba severas pruebas, se trazo un gran proyecto de dicha construccion para el enriquecimiento y la prosperidad de la patria y en todo el pais se desato una fiebre para alcanzar nuevos exitos portentosos e innovaciones. Se levantaron las furiosas llamas de la revolucion industrial en la nueva centuria, se abrio la era de la economia del conocimiento, se levantaron por doquier construcciones monumentales que representan a la epoca y se crearon muchos modelos de la cultura de Songun. Los valiosos bienes y realizaciones generados en la era de Songun por nuestro Ejercito y toda la poblacion bajo la sabia direccion del gran General, devienen preciosos haberes para el enriquecimiento y la prosperidad de la nacion de Kim Il Sung y la Corea de Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl dirigir la revolucion mediante Songun, el gran General imprimio nuevos cambios en el empeno por reunificar a la patria de manera independiente y preservo la paz y la seguridad en el mundo. Abrio la Era de la Reunificacion del 15 de Junio, sustentada en el ideal “entre nosotros, los connacionales”, preparo un valioso caudal para la reintegracion y coprosperidad nacionales y desbarato las interminables maquinaciones de los imperialistas encaminadas a provocar una guerra, defendiendo la paz en Asia y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas grandes hazanas realizadas por el companero Kim Jong Il para la patria, la revolucion, la epoca y la historia durante mas de medio siglo de su infalible direccion mediante Songun, brillaran eternamente en el victorioso avance de nuestra causa revolucionaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos heredar fielmente y perpetuar la gran idea revolucionaria de Songun del companero Kim Jong Il y sus proezas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa idea revolucionaria de Songun es la gran guia rectora de nuestra revolucion y los meritos realizados por el gran General en su direccion mediante Songun son moviles de la victoria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHeredar y llevar a cabo la causa revolucionaria del Juche enarbolando invariablemente la bandera de Songun es una inconmovible disposicion y ferrea voluntad de nuestro Partido, Ejercito y pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTenemos que seguir por el camino de Songun, el de la independencia y socialismo que el gran General recorrio en toda su vida, hacer realidad su legado y culminar con exito la causa revolucionaria del Juche y la de Songun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los funcionarios, militantes del Partido y otros trabajadores se armaran firmemente con la idea revolucionaria de Songun del companero Kim Jong Il, conoceran a fondo los grandes meritos que el realizo practicando Songun, los plasmaran al pie de la letra en los procesos revolucionario y constructivo y los haran perdurar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso materializar cabalmente el lineamiento que concede importancia al fusil, a los asuntos militares, y consolidar la capacidad defensiva del pais por todos los medios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos hacer del Ejercito Popular tropas de firme ideologia y fe, poderosas tropas revolucionarias de Paektusan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa direccion del Partido es como la vida para el Ejercito Popular, pues el poderio de este es inconcebible al margen de esa direccion. El Ejercito Popular tiene un solo rumbo que seguir: avanzar recto con el fusil apuntando hacia la direccion que senale el Partido. Nuestro fusil siempre ha de ser un inmutable punto de apoyo que ofrezca seguridad al Partido y a su causa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte cualquier prueba o cambio de situacion, los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular reconoceran unicamente al Partido y el Lider y arderan de una sola idea y determinacion de defenderlos a ultranza. Se pertrecharan con la ideologia revolucionaria de nuestro Partido y tendran la inconmovible disposicion a defender a costa de la vida la bandera roja de la revolucion, la bandera del Partido del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el Ejercito se dedicara con gran fervor al entrenamiento como lo hicieron los guerrilleros del monte Paektu, para formar a todos los militares como valerosos combatientes capaces de vencer uno a cien enemigos, que dominan las estrategias y tacticas militares de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il y poseen el heroico espiritu y formidable preparacion para el combate, asi como implantar una ferrea disciplina en las unidades y dotarlas de cualidades propias de las fuerzas regulares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara el mejor servicio de los militares, acondicionaran los puestos y cuarteles como sus propios hogares y crearan para ellos optimas condiciones de la vida material y cultural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular, mientras cumplen su mision principal que es defender el pais, deben dar grandes pasos de avance en distintos renglones e importantes obras de la construccion socialista y ser los primeros y siempre insatisfechos benefactores del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe requiere un gran empeno en el desarrollo de la industria de defensa nacional. En el sector se concentraran en lograr mayores exitos en el esfuerzo por hacer de nuestro pais la mayor potencia militar y produciran mas y mejores armamentos de gran precision, ligeros, automaticos e inteligentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Guardia Roja Obrero-Campesina elevara su combatividad mediante intensos ejercicios militares y politicos y se preparara para defender ante cualquier eventualidad sus provincias, distritos y suelo patrio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que dar grandes saltos e innovaciones en todos los sectores de la construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe impulsar mas la construccion de una potencia economica en fiel acato a la linea de nuestro Partido sobre el desarrollo paralelo (impulsar simultaneamente la construccion economica y la de las fuerzas armadas nucleares ? N.T.), a fin de elevar notablemente el nivel de la vida de la poblacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe renovaran la agricultura y la industria ligera, renglones principales para la construccion de la potencia economica, y se acelerara la construccion de viviendas para que los habitantes lleven una vida holgada y dichosa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe pondra enfasis en el sector priorizado de la economia nacional, la industria basica, de manera que tenga efecto la base independiente que hemos creado y se promoveran la modernizacion y la normal produccion de la rama. Particularmente, se pondra gran empeno en las industrias electrica y carbonifera, mientras que la metalurgica y la quimica seran columnas gemelas que hagan progresar el conjunto de la economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNos compete acelerar el desarrollo cientifico y tecnologico y preparar a todos los habitantes como cientificos y tecnicos de gran talento, para asi elevar el nivel de la modernizacion de la economia nacional, su dotacion con la tecnologia de CNC y completar su estructura conforme a la demanda de la era de la economia de conocimientos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso acelerar la construccion de un Estado socialista civilizado. Convertiremos a todos los miembros de la sociedad en artifices de la cultura socialista que tambien sepan disfrutar de ella, daremos un gran avance en todos los aspectos de la construccion cultural y haremos realidad el deseo de nuestra poblacion de gozar de una vida sana y culta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon miras a lograr un cambio decisivo en la construccion de un Estado socialista, poderoso y prospero, es menester elevar mas la funcion y el papel combativos de las organizaciones del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstas ultimas son unidades de vanguardia de la revolucion de Songun y por medio de ellas se materializan la ideologia y la direccion del Partido. Al tomar como linea principal de su trabajo implantar el sistema de direccion unica del Partido, conduciran a todos los cuadros, militantes y demas trabajadores a ser fieles a la ideologia y orientacion de su lider y desarrollar todas las actividades de acuerdo con el pensamiento y proposito del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la ofensiva general de hoy deben explotar al maximo la fuerza espiritual de los cuadros, miembros del Partido y trabajadores. La madre del prodigio es la fuerza espiritual de las masas y la llave maestra que abre una nueva era de prosperidad en la construccion del Estado poderoso y prospero esta en poner fuego en el alma de ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas organizaciones del Partido se esmeraran en la educacion de los cuadros, militantes y trabajadores encaminada a persuadirlos de la grandeza de la idea revolucionaria de Songun y los meritos del General Kim Jong Il y darles continuidad. Desarrollaran entre las masas una dinamica labor politica, similar a la que se hace en las trincheras en plena guerra, hasta que todos los cuadros, miembros del Partido y demas trabajadores hagan suyos el espiritu y estilo de trabajo de los militares del Ejercito Popular, dispuestos a sacrificarse para defender al Lider y materializar sus instrucciones, y aviven las llamas de la creacion de la “velocidad en el monte Masik”, exhibiendo plenamente el patriotismo de Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs indispensable vigorizar la gran campana de la construccion socialista mediante la cooperacion de los militares y civiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos hablando de un eficaz modo de trabajo que le permite a nuestro ejercito y pueblo desarrollar una ofensiva recia, unidos compactamente. Los altos cargos militares y civiles se esmeraran en la organizacion y el mando a favor de esa cooperacion, recurriran a la fuerza espiritual de los militares y civiles y a todos los medios para cumplir infaliblemente y a tiempo las tareas que asumen sus respectivas unidades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fiel acato al legado y el noble proposito de los grandes Generalisimos, debemos esforzarnos con denuedo por abrir una nueva coyuntura de la reunificacion de la patria, prevenir las agresiones y la guerra y defender la paz y seguridad en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInvencibles son nuestra ideologia y causa de la revolucion de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras la gran idea Juche, la idea revolucionaria de Songun, nos ilumina el camino a seguir y contamos con la sabia orientacion del Partido, la unidad monolitica militar-civil y el indestructible Ejercito Popular, es definitiva la victoria de la causa revolucionaria del Juche, la de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo en el pasado, cosecharemos para siempre la victoria, enarbolando la gran bandera del Songun."
