It is being glorified as the great mother party absolutely supported and trusted by broad masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The party has become an ideologically pure entity centered on the leader, an integral whole in terms of organization. This has been possible thanks to the party cells, lowest primary organizations which provide connection between the party and the masses and directly carry out the line and policies of the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il ushered in the new history of building a revolutionary party and made sure that the WPK has been built as the effective staff of the Songun revolution with its party cells operating in all areas and units where there are party members and other people. Their undying feats are shining brightly in the history of the WPK and the Juche revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under their care, the party cells have been strengthened into ranks of those who devotedly defend the leader, basic units executing the party's policies as well as its reliable pillars deeply rooted among the masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the requirement of the times and the revolution to effect a drastic turn in the party cell work and improve the party's image as mother party that works for the people when the DPRK is building a comprehensively prosperous socialist country rallied close around Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the secretaries of all party cells satisfactorily discharge their roles as standard-bearers of the revolution and struggle for defending and devotedly implementing the party's line and policies, can the WPK grow stronger as a genuine mother party that gives top priority to the interests of the popular masses and a harmonious whole sharing the destiny with the servicepersons and people, and the Juche revolution make steady progress forward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un saw to it that the meeting of secretaries of party cells would be held by attaching great importance to the role of the party cells and their secretaries in strengthening the WPK into the party guided by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as required by the times and the developing revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting will be attended by secretaries of the party cells who made contributions to the development of the WPK and prosperity of the country by building their cells into organizations with transparent revolutionary outlook on the leader and powerfully arousing broad masses to the effort for implementing the party policies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nomination of participants in the meeting and preparations for the meeting are now making successful progress in the whole party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting will help strengthen the unity and cohesion of the whole party in every way, centering on Kim Jong Un under the banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, remarkably bolster the might of the party as required by the developing revolution and thus spur the army and people in their drive to win a final victory."

A girl student was trampled down by jackboots and heads of civilians were left broken and even housewives and babies on kiddy cars were exposed to tear gas. Lawmakers from opposition parties who had tried to stop the crackdown and media persons were bitten by police. A resident died due to torture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During candlelight demonstrations the puppet prosecution released more than 52,300 warrants for search and at least 2,500 people were walked off and more than 3,000 others were left wounded. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1,842 political parties and organizations were branded as ones which organized illegal and violent demonstrations and families of those demonstrators fell victim to the suppression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the summer of 2009 the Lee group brutally suppressed the workers of Ssangyong Motors in Phyongthaek City, Kyonggi Province for their actions against massive dismissal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group suspended the supply of electricity, water and food to more than 900 workers on a sit-in strike for more than 70 days in an attempt to choke them. Then, thousands of policemen and gangsters mercilessly cracked down upon the protesters by mobilizing helicopters and armored cars. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The repressive operation left over 300 sit-in strikers wounded and forced four workers and their families to commit suicides or die of heart attack. 96 protesters were walked off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean public circles and media protested against it as follows: \"Ssangyong Motors is a huge scene of human rights abuses\", \"It reminds one of the Kwangju incident in 1980\" and \"It is horrible massacre putting the genocide perpetrated by the military dictatorial group into the shade.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the fascist regime mercilessly suppressed actions of south Koreans from all walks life for defending their vital rights such as ones staged by the Freight Workers' Solidarity, Government Employees' Union, Railway Workers' Union, south Korean Teachers Union and the action of university students for having the registration fee halved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why the south Korean people bitterly condemned the conservative regime for pursuing a \"barbarous and frantic terror policy\", \"policy violating democracy and killing common people,\" while calling Lee Hitler of Nazi Germany.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are too many examples to cite sinister political plots and retaliatory actions that forced even an ex-president to die in despair, gag on the press and the campaign to crack down upon the democratic forces conducted under the pretext of \"eliminating the forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, the majority of junior and senior high schoolers said that they wanted to live abroad out of their extreme disillusion about south Korean society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights situation in south Korea has reached the worst phase in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime has been talkative about human rights during its office but the situation showed that it put the erstwhile military fascist gangsters into the shade in human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards this situation, a publication of south Korea said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The existence of the Lee Myung Bak regime itself serves as a lethal weapon. In a word it is a group of those who refused to remain human beings. The regime is a violent group regarding the weak in society as an enemy and the fascist regime suppressing and arresting those advocating democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become a monster for its greed for capital and power. Lee Myung Bak is the main culprit of all tragedies. The only thing he does well is spadework.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His single spadework brings more profits to the rich while worsening the living of the poor. Worse still, they fall victim to his spade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The five years of Lee's office is, indeed, a period of nightmare, horror and despair as he turned south Korea into a tundra of democracy and human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights abuses of Lee will never be pardoned."
