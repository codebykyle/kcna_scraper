On July 6 and September 1 it dropped tear, asphyxiating and other toxic gases in the area of Wonsan and several areas of South and North Hwanghae provinces, poisoning and killing many people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They even made no scruple of mixing poisonous substances in sweets, biscuits, taffy, toasts, canned food, shellfish and other foodstuff and bank notes before dropping them from planes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists used prisoners from our side as guinea pigs for germ and chemical warfare in wanton violation of international agreement on treatment of POWs and killed them in a barbarous way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Revealing that the U.S. resorted to bio-chemical war even after the conclusion of the Armistice Agreement, the indictment continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. introduced to south Korea a detachment of the U.S. micro-biological research institute under unit 406 of the germ weapons institute of the U.S. army stationed in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan in 1976 and set up germ research institutes at Korea University, Kyunghee University, etc. where they carried out the experiment of epidemic hemorrhagic fever, malignant infectious disease of high fatality, thus verifying the effect of its spread.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. man-killers even used the internal organs of living persons and even embryos for the experiment of germ weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It viciously carried out the preparations for chemical warfare targeting the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. which had openly cried out for \"continued modernization of poisonous materials for battles, one of fundamental elements of the U.S. military potentials\" has massively introduced into south Korea and stockpiled there a huge amount of chemical weapons and toxic chemical materials including binary chemical weapons whose use is banned internationally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces of south Korea who witnessed the efficiency of bio-chemical weapons when the U.S. used them in the Vietnamese war, began to develop bio-chemical weapons in June 1981.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have pushed ahead with the joint development of germ and chemical weapons with research institutes under the U.S. Defense Department and the U.S. Army while reinforcing the think-tank of their own germ weapons research institute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also egged not only munitions enterprises but also civilian enterprises on to massively develop and produce bio-chemical weapons with the approval of the U.S. master on possession of independent bio-chemical warfare capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces also let germ weapons research institute massively breed various insects, ticks and rodents for the experiment on living bodies of germs and viruses and made several universities including Korea University and Kyunghee University to set up germ research institutes in collaboration with the U.S. and develop new pathogens of high contagiousness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These facts are just a tip of iceberg of bio-chemical warfare committed by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces on the Korean peninsula during the Korean war and the postwar period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international organizations including the UN and the world people should take the U.S. to the international war criminal tribunal for such hideous crimes as taking lives of a number of Koreans through murderous germ and chemical warfare and polluting the land of Korea, sternly punish war criminals under international law and force them to pay a thousand-fold price for the huge damage they caused to the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces can not evade punishment as they are accomplices with the U.S. in its germ and chemical warfare. They should apologize before the nation and face stern punishment for defending and conniving at the U.S. germ warfare that had already been disclosed before the world and committing such thrice-cursed crimes as rubbing salt on the wounds of a great number of victims and their bereaved families."

It went through legal procedures concerning territorial possession and declared it at home and abroad. It was five years before the Japanese imperialists fabricated \"Shimane Prefectural Proclamation\" No. 40.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Dr. and Associate Prof. Ri Kwang Hui, deputy dean of a faculty of Kim Il Sung University, noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has historically committed the moves to grab Ullung Island and Tok Islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's moves to invade Tok Islets had persisted till its occupation of Korea, beginning with its invasion of Ullung Island in the latter half of the 14th century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Imjin Patriotic War the Japanese troops intruded into the island, turning it into debris and in the 17th century they plundered Ullung Island and Tok Islets of their vast area of forest and marine resources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan hatched a new plot to hold the dominium over Ullung Island and Tok Islets while officially recognizing the Korean feudal dynasty's dominium over those territories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In December 1869 right after the \"Meiji Restoration\", Japan sent high-ranking officials of the Foreign Ministry to Korea to learn about the historical background against which Ullung Island and Tok Islets came under the jurisdiction of Korea. In 1882 when sending Hanabusa as a representative having full mandate after soldiers' uprising in Korea, Japan gave him a secret instruction to take over Ullung Island from the Korean feudal dynasty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dr. and Associate Prof. Han Yong Chan, deputy rector of Kim Chol Ju University of Education, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's \"dominium over Tok Islets\" is a shameless distortion of history full of deception, conspiracy and crafty trick, when viewed from \"Shimane Prefectural Proclamation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Shimane Prefectural Proclamation\" is proven to be illegal and false document through international conventions on postwar handling of Japanese territory as they defined Tok Islets as land to be abandoned by Japan and made them land of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration also made it clear that areas Japan grabbed by violence out of greed are excluded from Japan's territory and clearly defined four main islands and \"several small islets\" to be decided by allies in the future as Japan's territory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dr. and Associate Prof. Hwang Myong Chol, room chief of the Academy of Social Sciences, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's dominium over \"Tok Islets\" is a revelation of its militarist ambition for territorial expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An immediate aim sought by Japan through its territorial claim to Tok Islets is to seize rich natural resources in the waters off Tok Islets, hold a monopoly of economic interests there and thus provide an outpost and a military bridgehead from which to realize its territorial ambition and attempt at reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries consider the DPRK as the primary target of their overseas aggression and dream of advancing into the continent with Korea as a springboard in a bid to dominate Asia once again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The speakers demanded the Japanese reactionaries retract at once the shameless \"claim to Tok Islets\" and \"Day of Takeshima\" and stop their rash actions prompted by an anachronistic daydream."

Korean FM's Reckless Remarks against DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- Yun Pyong Se, south Korean foreign minister, when meeting with the U.S. secretary of State recently, talked rubbish that the nuclear deterrent of the DPRK is a \"main factor of uneasiness\" and \"it is necessary to press for denuclearization process\", echoing the U.S utterance about \"nuclear threat from the north\". Yun was closeted with the latter over cooperation and joint efforts to cope with \"nuclear issue of the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a commentary observes in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One cannot but be shocked at the fact that such a fool running riot, unaware of the real \"factor of uneasiness\" on the Korean peninsula, is leading the south Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK are the main factor of making the situation on the Korean peninsula unstable and escalating tension there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. worked out a dangerous war scenario calling for \"prompt use of nukes\" against the DPRK and staged ill-famed joint military drills every year, systematically escalating the military threat and blackmail against the latter. It is hard reality that due to the nuclear war moves of the U.S., the Korean nation has suffered constant uneasiness and pain, and the stability and peace on the peninsula have been seriously disturbed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This notwithstanding, Yun termed the DPRK's nuclear deterrent for self-defence a \"main factor of uneasiness\" while shelving the U.S. brigandish nuclear threat and blackmail. One cannot but be skeptical about whether he has normal thinking power or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What traitor Yun uttered this time is a clear indication of the south Korean puppet group's inveterate pro-U.S. consciousness and wild ambition for escalating confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality again clearly proves that the puppet group hasn't got even an iota of concern for north-south dialogue and mending of north-south relations but only pursues a wild ambition to do harm to compatriots with the backing of outsiders."
